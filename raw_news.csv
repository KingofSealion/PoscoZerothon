This wave has travelled below its 100% projection level of $4.53 and has completed a pullback. It may keep falling toward $4.46-3/4.

A retracement analysis on the uptrend from $4.36-1/2 reveals support of $4.50-3/4, which triggered only a very weak bounce, or pullback.

The speculation is that the support may not hold. The next support will be around $4.47-1/4, the 61.8% level. A break above $4.53 may lead to a gain into $4.54-1/4 to $4.55-1/4 range.

On the daily chart, the contract observes a series of projection levels on a wave C from $4.97-1/4. The break below $4.52-3/4 opened the way toward $4.42-1/2.

Favourable crop prospects offset US exports

Soybeans edge down on supply pressure, biofuel uncertainty

Updates with European trading, changes byline/dateline

By Gus Trompiz and Naveen Thukral

PARIS/SINGAPORE, May 30 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat and corn edged higher on Friday as the cereal markets consolidated after losses this week linked to favourable U.S. and global harvest prospects.

Soybeans ticked lower to hold near Thursday's three-week low, curbed by expectations of ample supplies along with uncertainty over biofuel demand as the U.S. government considers waivers for oil refiners.

A firmer dollar =USD kept grain prices in check as grain markets awaited an update on demand from weekly U.S. export sales figures later on Friday.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 rose 0.7% to $5.37-3/4 a bushel by 1015 GMT. Corn Cv1 added 0.5% to $4.49-1/4 a bushel to steady after a one-week low on Thursday.

CBOT soybeans Sv1 inched down 0.1% at $10.50-1/2 a bushel to consolidate above Thursday's low of $10.40.

Agricultural consultancy Sovecon on Thursday raised its forecast for Russia's wheat exports for the 2025-2026 season by 1.1 million metric tons to 40.8 million tons, citing improved weather conditions for the harvest.

India is likely to produce a record 117.5 million metric tons of wheat in the year ending June 2025, the farm ministry said, above its March forecast of 115.4 million tons.

In the U.S., winter wheat conditions are at a five-year high despite an unexpected decline last week, while regular showers have helped most corn and soybean crops get off to a good start to their growing season.

With expectations rising for Brazil's upcoming second corn crop, the corn market found little support in large export sales reported on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

""Despite exceptional export sales reported by the USDA ?”amounting to 205,096 tons for the 2024/25 campaign ??market support remains absent,"" Argus Media analysts said in a note.

The soybean market was assessing a Reuters report that the White House is considering a plan to clear a record backlog of requests from small refineries for exemptions from U.S. biofuel laws.

The stabilization of the price around support of $4.43-1/4 indicates a completion of the wave c from $4.63. Given that the contract has broken resistance of $4.47-1/4, it is likely to test the next resistance at $4.50-3/4.

53,London copper set for slight weekly gains as weak dollar aids,"Recasts headline, updates prices after Asia markets close

NEW DELHI, May 23 (Reuters) - Copper prices in London were poised for slim weekly gains on Friday, supported by a softer dollar, although the upside was limited due to persisting uncertainty over U.S. tariffs.

Benchmark copper CMCU3 on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was up 0.1% at $9,513 a metric ton, as of 0703 GMT. It has risen 0.7% so far this week.

The U.S. dollar was weaker on Friday and was set to log its first weekly drop in five against the euro and the yen, making greenback-priced commodities more attractive for buyers using other currencies. USD/

The weakness in the dollar has been exacerbated by worries over the United States' worsening fiscal health, sending investors scurrying for safe havens.

Last week, the U.S. and China agreed to reduce tit-for-tat tariffs and implement a 90-day pause on actions, but there is no clarity on what will follow after the temporary truce.

""There are uncertainties lingering around what will happen after the 90-day truce,"" said ANZ Commodity Strategist Soni Kumari.

""Market will consolidate in the current range around $9,400-$9,500 a metric ton. And, once we start seeing slowdown of copper imports into the U.S. that will pull down prices a bit.""

Among other London metals, aluminium CMAL3 was up 0.2% at $2,462 a ton, zinc CMZN3 was down 0.2% to $2,693.5, lead CMPB3 added 0.8% to $1,985.5 and nickel CMNI3 was up 0.1% to $15,510. Tin CMSN3 firmed 0.5% to $32,545.

The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) was down 0.2% at 77,790 yuan ($10,805.67) per ton.

SHFE aluminium SAFcv1 was down 0.2% to 20,155 yuan a ton, zinc SZNcv1 eased 0.07% to 22,415 yuan, lead SPBcv1 was up 0.5% at 16,860 yuan, nickel SNIcv1 edged 0.7% lower to 122,610 yuan, and tin SSNcv1 fell 0.5% to 264,600 yuan.

70,Copper steady after US court puts brakes on Trump tariffs,"Updates prices at 1627 GMT

May 29 (Reuters) - Copper prices steadied on Thursday, lifted by market optimism after a federal court halted President Donald Trump's move to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from most of the United States' trading partners.

The Court of International Trade blocked most of Trump's tariffs in a broad ruling on Wednesday that found the president had overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports.

The Trump administration minutes later filed a notice of appeal and questioned the authority of the court.

ING commodities analyst Ewa Manthey said copper gained because the court ruling boosted risk appetite, though markets were likely to remain volatile as the administration fights the decision.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 was little changed at $9,567 per metric ton by 1627 GMT.

LME copper has rebounded nearly 19% since touching a 17-month low of $8,105 in April after Trump imposed his so-called reciprocal tariffs.

Also supporting the market was a softer U.S. dollar, reversing earlier gains, as investors prepared for a battle over the tariffs. A weaker dollar makes commodities prices in the U.S. currency less expensive for buyers using other currencies. USD/

Discussing the outlook for copper, Manthey noted that downside risks include prolonged trade negotiations and reduced policy stimulus from China. On the upside, prices could benefit from possible cuts in refined copper production amid ongoing tightness in concentrates, he said.

Market attention also remained fixed on Washington's ongoing investigation into potential copper import tariffs, which has kept the COMEX copper premium over the LME benchmark elevated and spurred a surge of metal inflows into COMEX-owned warehouses HG-STX-COMEX.

U.S. Comex copper futures HGc3 dipped 0.1% to $4.70 a lb, bringing the Comex premium over LME to $792 a ton.

Meanwhile, Chile's state copper commission Cochilco raised its average copper price forecast for this year and next, citing an improved global outlook following a pause in the tariff war between the United States and China.

Among other metals, LME aluminium CMAL3 eased 0.7% to $2,451.50 a ton, zinc CMZN3 slipped 0.5% to $2,673, lead CMPB3 fell 1% to $1,962 and tin CMSN3 gave up 1.9% to $31,035. Nickel CMNI3 gained 2.5% to $15,380.

71,Copper on track for biggest monthly rise since September,"Updates prices

LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - Copper prices fell on Friday under pressure from a stronger dollar, but remained on course for their biggest monthly rise in eight months due to tighter nearby supply, highlighted by the premium for nearby copper contracts against those further out.

Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) CMCU3 lost 0.6% to $9,510 a metric ton by 1602 GMT. The contract is up 4.2% so far in May, on track for its strongest month since September.

The price advance is supported by declining stocks in LME-registered warehouses MCUSTX-TOTAL, down 45% since mid-February to 149,875 tons, the lowest in almost a year. Copper inventories in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 7.2% this week.

As Washington continues an investigation into whether to impose new U.S. copper import tariffs, the premium of COMEX copper against the LME benchmark remains elevated, attracting more metal into COMEX-owned warehouses. HG-STX-COMEX

""The LME copper is facing a bit of a squeeze because the COMEX stocks keep going up and the LME stocks are declining,"" said Dan Smith, managing director at Commodity Market Analytics.

The spread between the cash LME and the three-month copper contract CMCU0-3 closed on Thursday at a premium of $51.6 a ton, highest since November 2022, indicating worries about nearby supply, partly due to a large holding of 0#LME-WHC copper warrants and cash contracts.

The premium, which was last at $50.4 on Friday, also reflected uncertainty about the supply from Kamoa-Kakula copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Smith added.

As a group, industrial metals were under pressure as the dollar strengthened and market optimism faded following a court ruling that reinstated the broad tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.

As to the demand side, the focus was on the official purchasing managers' index (PMI) in top metals consumer China, due on Saturday. China's factory activity likely contracted for a second month in May, a Reuters poll showed.

The Yangshan copper premium SMM-CUYP-CN, a gauge of China's appetite to import copper, fell 6.5% this week to $86 a ton.

LME aluminium CMAL3 and lead CMPB3 fell 0.2% to $2,444 a ton and $1,958 respectively. Zinc CMZN3 slipped 1.5% to $2,634.50, tin CMSN3 dropped 3.5% to $30,150 and nickel CMNI3 was down 0.5% at $15,295.

China's commodity futures markets will be closed on Monday for the Dragon Boat holiday.

72,"London copper rises on weaker dollar, but US-China trade conflict caps gains","SINGAPORE, June 2 (Reuters) - Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange climbed on Monday, supported by a weaker dollar, although renewed U.S.-China trade tensions raised supply chain concerns and limited further upside in metal prices.

Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) CMCU3 was up 0.7% at $9,561.5 per metric ton, as of 0135 GMT.

China's commodity markets were closed on Monday for the Dragon Boat holiday.

The dollar edged lower, paring gains seen last week, as markets assessed the potential growth and inflation risks from U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff policy.

Trade tensions intensified after Trump said on Friday he planned to increase tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to 50% from 25%, ratcheting up pressure on global steel producers.

China's manufacturing activity contracted in May for a second month, an official survey showed on Saturday, fuelling expectations for more stimulus to support the economy amid a protracted trade war with the United States.

18,News: RPT-COLUMN-Crop Watch: Corn improves but soy health is lacking -Braun,"Repeats column first published on Monday. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a market analyst for Reuters.

By Karen Braun

NAPERVILLE, Illinois, June 2 (Reuters) - Although not all fields have emerged, U.S. Crop Watch soybean conditions are starting out on their worst note in at least five years, similar to the corn ratings a week ago.

Only eight of the 11 Crop Watch soybean fields are available for rating this week, and the unweighted average condition score comes in at 3.56. That compares with a range of 3.75 to 3.91 for the same eight fields at this point in the past three seasons, and a 4.34 in 2021.

The Crop Watch producers each week assign condition scores to their corn and soybean fields using a scale of 1 to 5. The ratings are similar to the U.S. Department of Agriculture?™s system where 1 is very poor, 3 is average and 5 is excellent.

However, the Crop Watch condition scores are mostly visual in nature and do not incorporate yield assumptions.

No bean scores are available this week in Kansas and North Dakota given the very recent planting dates. The Ohio beans are expected to be sown this week, and the producer has no concerns over this later timing.

Crop Watch conditions are in the 2-range for soy fields in southeastern Illinois and South Dakota, the latter of which was replanted on Sunday. Although the eastern Iowa beans currently score a 4, the producer notes a lot of replanting in the area with very thin plants.



CHANCE FOR IMPROVEMENT?

USDA on Monday afternoon will issue its first U.S. soybean conditions of the season, and the Crop Watch results could suggest that upside is limited. This happened last week with USDA?™s corn ratings, which were the lowest initial conditions since 2019.

This week, the 11-field, average Crop Watch corn condition score rose to 3.68 from 3.57 last week, which had been the lowest start for Crop Watch corn ratings in at least five years.

Corn health improved notably in South Dakota and slightly in both Nebraska and western Iowa. Corn in all three locations had been battered by wind, hail, frost, rains and heat in the latter part of May.


The past week started unseasonably cool for most of the Corn Belt except for North Dakota. Nebraska, Kansas and Ohio were the only locations that had notable rainfall last week out of the 11 Crop Watch areas.

Warmth arrived for some of the fields over the weekend, though the Crop Watch producers were mixed when asked if last week?™s weather helped the crops or held them back.

Most producers still want some heat for both corn and beans, but the week ahead will mostly feature milder temperatures. This could still allow for some improvement in crop conditions if the accompanying rainfall is not excessive, though the forecast suggests larger totals are possible in the central Corn Belt.

U.S. spring wheat conditions came in shockingly low last week, though the North Dakota producer says that wheat in his east-central location improved over the last week with the dryness and warmth.

Analysts expect U.S. spring wheat conditions on Monday afternoon to rise to 47% good-to-excellent (GE) from 45% last week. Corn is seen improving to 69% GE from 68% last week.

U.S. soybean conditions are predicted to come in at 68% GE, equivalent to the five-year average for initial bean ratings. Those initial scores ranged from 62% to 72%, leaving some leeway for this year?™s number.

37,"News: UPDATE 1-USDA's US corn, spring wheat ratings fall below expectations","CHICAGO, May 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Tuesday rated 68% of the U.S. corn crop as good to excellent in its first condition ratings for the 2025 crop, below the average estimate of 73% in a Reuters analyst poll.

Pre-report trade estimates from 14 analysts surveyed by Reuters had ranged from 64% to 78% good to excellent. The United States is the world's largest exporter of corn, used primarily for animal feed and ethanol fuel.

In its weekly crop progress report, the USDA said U.S. farmers had planted 87% of their intended corn acres by Sunday, up from 78% a week earlier and ahead of the five-year average of 85%.

Soybean planting was 76% complete, behind the average estimate in the Reuters poll of 78%. The USDA's figure was up from 66% a week ago and well ahead of the five-year average of 68%. The government expects to release soybean condition ratings starting with next week's report.

In its first 2025 condition ratings for spring wheat, grown mostly in the northern Plains, the USDA rated only 45% of the crop as good to excellent, below even the lowest in a wide range of analyst expectations. Analysts on average had expected the government to rate 71% of the spring wheat crop as good to excellent, with estimates ranging from 54% to 76%.

Heavy rains crossed the northern Plains last week, bringing moisture to areas that had been struggling with drought. As of May 20, 29% of the U.S. spring wheat crop was located in an area experiencing drought, the USDA said last week, a drop from 38% the previous week.

Spring wheat planting was 87% complete by Sunday, the USDA said, behind the average trade estimate of 90% but ahead of the five-year average of 80%.

For winter wheat, the agency rated 50% of the crop as good to excellent, down from 52% the previous week while analysts on average had expected a one-point improvement. Still, the winter wheat rating was the highest for this time of year since 2020.

In the government's first corn ratings for 2025, analysts on average expected the USDA to rate 73% of the crop in good to excellent condition. Estimates ranged from 64% to 78% good-to-excellent.

""Ongoing rains continue to plague the southern Corn Belt, but the bulk of the Midwest has been in nearly ideal shape for planting and early crop development,"" StoneX market analyst Matt Zeller wrote in a note. The United States is the world's largest exporter of corn, used primarily for animal feed and ethanol fuel.

For soybeans, analysts on average expected the USDA's report to show planting as 78% complete by Sunday, up from 66% a week ago. The USDA did not expect to release soybean condition ratings in Tuesday's report given that only 34% of the soy crop had emerged from the ground as of last week, while corn emergence had reached 50%.

The USDA also planned to release its first crop condition ratings of the year for spring wheat, and analysts on average expected a rating of 71% good-to-excellent. Estimates ranged widely from 54% to 76% good-to-excellent.

13,"News: Farmers in EU raise alarm over Mercosur, Ukraine trade deals","French farmers urge Macron to rally EU support against Mercosur deal

Comments come ahead of visit by Brazil's Lula

Spanish farmers protest in Madrid against cheap competition

By Sybille de La Hamaide and Inti Landauro

PARIS/MADRID, June 4 (Reuters) - French and Spanish farmers warned on Wednesday that a flood of imports under planned European Union trade agreements with South American bloc Mercosur and Ukraine risked severely undermining European agriculture.

The concerns come ahead of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's official visit to France and the expiry on Thursday of a free trade deal with Ukraine, which is expected to shift to import quotas this summer.

Lula said on Tuesday he would discuss the EU-Mercosur deal with President Emmanuel Macron, a strong critic of the agreement in its current form, which was finalised in December but still needs approval from member states.

In a meeting with members of parliament, French farmers' groups urged Macron to rally enough partners to form a blocking minority against the Mercosur deal, which they say would be devastating for the beef, poultry and sugar industries and compromise the EU's ambitions in terms of food sovereignty.

""It would be a real tragedy for our industry,"" Alain Carre, head of French sugar industry group AIBS said. ""We're sounding the alarm.""

French farmers held nationwide protests last year over low incomes, rising costs, and competition from cheap imports, particularly from Ukraine and Mercosur countries, demanding fairer trade terms and lighter regulation.

""Our demands (for an EU-Mercosur agreement) are simple: reciprocity of rules, traceability abroad and much clearer labelling,"" Jean-Michel Schaeffer, head of French poultry industry group Anvol, said.

Meanwhile, a few hundred farmers protested in Madrid against cheap grain imports from Ukraine and other countries, saying prices have fallen below production costs.

Spanish farmers are likely to lose 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) this year, said Javier Fatas, a leader of farmers union COAG from the Aragon region in northeastern Spain.

""This happens because of trade deals signed by Spain and the EU as part of geopolitics, bringing us prices too low to sustain our farms,"" Fatas said.

He warned that genetically modified grains from Mercosur also created unfair competition, echoing French farmers' concerns.

Wednesday's protest was peaceful, but only the beginning, he added. ""Bad times are coming.""

Here are the main EU import quotas for Mercosur products in the agreement:

65,London metals gain after US court blocks Trump's tariffs,"Adds comment, updates prices for Asia market close

May 29 (Reuters) - Prices of metals in London rose on Thursday, buoyed by upbeat market sentiment after a U.S. federal court blocked President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs from going into effect, although a stronger dollar kept gains in check.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 was up 0.6% to $9,622 per metric ton, as of 0710 GMT.

The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) SCFcv1 gained 0.1% at 78,130 yuan ($10,865.57) per ton.

LME aluminium CMAL3 gained 0.6% to $2,483 a ton, zinc CMZN3 rose 1.1% to $2,717, lead CMPB3 was up 0.3% at $1,987.50 and nickel CMNI3 gained 1.3% to $15,205. Tin CMSN3 was up 0.4% to $31,745.

Base metals are up slightly after a U.S. trade court ruled that the bulk of Trump's tariffs are illegal under existing trade law, but the real action seems to be taking place in the U.S. equity markets, Marex consultant Edward Meir said in a note.

The Court of International Trade on Wednesday ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by imposing his April 2 across-the-board duties on imports from U.S. trade partners.

This boosted risk sentiment in the wider financial markets, while also sending the U.S. dollar index .DXY to its highest level in more than a week.MKTS/GLOB

A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated assets more expensive to holders of other currencies. USD/

Chile's state copper commission Cochilco raised its average copper price forecast for this year and next on Wednesday, citing an improved global outlook following a pause in the tariff war between the United States and China.

Copper, used in power and construction, is up 5% so far this month as global trade tensions eased compared to April when Trump announced reciprocal tariffs.

""Unplanned disruptions and supply outages in copper are increasing, exacerbated by China's rise in refining capacity, creating tightness in concentrate markets and lowering treatment charges,"" ANZ said in a note.

SHFE aluminium SAFcv1 was up 0.3% at 20,200 yuan a ton, lead SPBcv1 was steady at 16,750 yuan, nickel SNIcv1 fell 0.6% to 120,480 yuan, while zinc SZNcv1 gained 0.6% at 22,495 yuan and tin SSNcv1 fell 1.5% to 257,870 yuan.

67,Copper drifts lower on firmer dollar,"Updates prices

LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - Copper prices eased on Wednesday as a stronger dollar and signs of slowing import demand in China offset support from tighter nearby supply in the London Metal Exchange's system.

Benchmark three-month copper CMCU3 on the LME was down 0.4% at $9,553 a metric ton by 1603 GMT, after hitting a two-week high of $9,655 earlier in the session.

Copper, used in power and construction, is up 5% so far this month as global trade tensions eased compared to April when U.S. President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs.

Providing support to the metal are declining stocks in LME-registered warehouses MCUSTX-TOTAL, down 43% since mid-February to 154,300 tons, the lowest in almost a year.

The spread between the cash LME and the three-month copper contract CMCU0-3 was last at a premium of $47 a ton compared with $3 a week ago, indicating tighter nearby supply.

However, signalling easing import demand from top consumer China, the Yangshan copper premium SMM-CUYP-CN fell 5% to $89 a ton on Wednesday, its lowest since April 24.

Meanwhile, Washington is continuing an investigation into whether to impose new copper import tariffs, keeping the premium of COMEX copper against the LME benchmark LMECMXCUc3 elevated and attracting more metal into COMEX-owned warehouses HG-STX-COMEX.

""If a tariff is applied, the incentive to move copper to the U.S. will cease, in our view prompting more physical flow into the LME, a price headwind,"" analysts at BNP Paribas said in a note.

""If there is no tariff or the potential tariff rate is far less than expected we think CME prices will collapse, with a negative knock-on impact on LME prices,"" it added.

BNP Paribas expects average LME copper prices at $8,610 in the third quarter before a rise to $9,180 in the fourth quarter.

From the global supply point of view, the copper market was in a surplus of 289,000 tons in January-March compared with 268,000 tons a year earlier, according to the International Copper Study Group.

Among other LME metals, aluminium CMAL3 was down 0.9% at $2,463 a ton, zinc CMZN3 fell 0.7% to $2,686.50, lead CMPB3 eased 0.2% to $1,980.50, tin CMSN3 dropped 3.3% to $31,455 and nickel CMNI3 lost 2.3% to $15,055.

17,"News: CBOT Trends-Wheat up 4-5 cents, corn up 3-4, soy up 3-6","CHICAGO, June 3 (Reuters) - The following are U.S. expectations for the resumption of grain and soy complex trading at the Chicago Board of Trade at 8:30 a.m. CDT (1330 GMT) on Tuesday.


WHEAT - Up 4 to 5 cents per bushel

CBOT wheat Wv1 edged higher as traders focused on tensions in the Black Sea, though better-than-expected U.S. crop ratings put pressure on prices.

The contract had risen sharply during Monday's session as a Ukrainian drone attack in Russia shifted attention back on the war between the two grain exporters.

Ukraine's 2025 grain harvest may decrease by 10% to around 51 million metric tons, compared with 56.7 million tons in 2024, according to the most pessimistic estimates, Ukrainian agriculture minister Vitaliy Koval said on Tuesday.

In its weekly crop progress report released after Monday's close, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 50% of U.S. spring wheat and 52% of winter wheat were in good to excellent condition, up from the prior week and exceeding average analyst expectations.

CBOT July soft red winter wheat WN25 was last 4-3/4 cents to $5.43-3/4 per bushel. K.C. July hard red winter wheat KWN25 was last up 2-3/4 cents to $5.42-1/2 per bushel. Minneapolis July spring wheat MWEN25 was last down 3-1/2 cents to $6.23-3/4 a bushel.



CORN - Up 3 to 4 cents per bushel

CBOT corn Cv1 gained, though a large corn crop, global competition and decent crop ratings kept a lid on prices.

The USDA's corn rating improved to 69% good-to-excellent, up a percentage point from last week and in line with trade expectations.

CBOT July corn CN25 was last up 3-3/4 cents at $4.42 per bushel.


SOYBEANS - Up 3 to 6 cents per bushel

CBOT soybeans Sv1 crept higher as concerns over the condition of the U.S. soy crop and a higher soybean crush drove prices higher.

The USDA rated 67% of U.S. soybeans in good to excellent condition in its initial ratings of the 2025 soy crop, just below an average of analyst estimates for 68% but roughly on par with previous years.

The soybean market has also been pressured by renewed trade tensions between the United States and China.

CBOT July soybeans SN25 were last up 6-1/4 cents to $10.39-3/4 per bushel.

54,London copper edges higher as dollar weakens,"NEW DELHI, May 23 (Reuters) - Copper prices in London edged higher on Friday, supported by a softer dollar, and were poised for weekly gains, although the upside was limited due to persisting uncertainty over U.S. tariffs.

Benchmark copper CMCU3 on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was up 0.3% at $9,527.5 a metric ton, as of 0225 GMT. It was up 0.8% for the week.

The U.S. dollar was soft on Friday and is set to log its first weekly drop in five weeks against the euro and the yen, making greenback-priced commodities more attractive for buyers using other currencies. USD/

The weakness in the dollar has been exacerbated by worries over the United States' worsening fiscal health, sending investors scurrying for safe havens.

Last week, the U.S. and China agreed to reduce tit-for-tat tariffs and implement a 90-day pause on actions but there is no clarity on what will follow after the temporary truce.

""There are uncertainties lingering around what will happen after the 90-day truce,"" said ANZ Commodity Strategist Soni Kumari.

""Market will consolidate in the current range around $9,400-$9,500 a metric ton. And, once we start seeing slowdown of copper imports into the U.S. that will pull down prices a bit.""

Among other London metals, aluminium CMAL3 was up 0.3% at $2,464.5 a ton, zinc CMZN3 firmed 0.7% to $2,715, lead CMPB3 added 0.5% to $1,980 and nickel CMNI3 was up 0.3% to $15,540. Tin CMSN3 firmed 0.4% to $32,500.

The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) was up 0.03% at 77,930 yuan ($10,822.71) per ton.

SHFE aluminium SAFcv1 was unchanged at 20,195 yuan a ton, zinc SZNcv1 added 0.5% to 22,540 yuan, lead SPBcv1 was up 0.2% at 16,820 yuan, nickel SNIcv1 edged 0.3% lower to 123,130 yuan, and tin SSNcv1 fell 0.3% to 264,990 yuan.

86,Oil prices rise ahead of key OPEC+ meeting and global tensions,"Oil prices experienced a significant increase this Friday, just before the expected meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) . This increase takes place in a context of international uncertainty, marked by the nuclear negotiations between the United States and Iran and the recent trade threats by former President Donald Trump. Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 0.53%, closing at 64.78 dollars per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 0.54%, reaching 61.53 dollars per barrel.

During the day, oil prices suffered a sharp drop following Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on European products. However, they managed to recover later, reflecting how political and trade decisions can directly affect the global energy market. Analysts warn that the market is in a complex position, with concerns about the impact of tariffs on global oil demand and the possible increase in production by OPEC+ countries.

The OPEC+ meeting will be crucial in determining whether production will be adjusted for July. Although officially it is argued that there is market balance and limited global reserves, skepticism persists. Saudi Arabia, a key player in the organization, is seeking to pressure countries that are not meeting their production quotas, while responding to Trump's requests to increase supply. These domestic dynamics add an additional layer of uncertainty to the market.

In addition, tensions in the Middle East continue to weigh on the market. The possibility of an Israeli attack on nuclear facilities in Iran has raised concerns about potential armed conflict. Historically, such tensions have led to increases in oil prices due to the risk of supply disruptions. The current situation is no different, and investors are on the lookout for any developments in the region that could affect the flow of oil.

For several years now, the oil market has been heavily influenced by external factors such as trade wars, geopolitical tensions and decisions by major producers. The OPEC+ meeting will be a key point in defining how production will evolve and whether prices will remain stable or swing again. The organization's ability to manage these pressures will be decisive for the future of the energy market.

The impact of OPEC+ decisions is not limited to oil prices. It also affects the economies of producing and consuming countries, influencing inflation, economic growth and financial stability. For this reason, the eyes of the world are on the next meeting, where decisions are expected to be made that could have repercussions at a global level.

Mexican economy
Mexico reports trade deficit in April despite higher exports

In this context, the nuclear negotiations between the United States and Iran add another layer of complexity. An agreement could lead to an increase in Iranian oil production, which would affect the market balance. However, the current tensions and lack of concrete progress maintain uncertainty, which could continue to push prices higher in the short term.

Trump's trade threats also play a crucial role in this scenario. The possibility of new tariffs could affect oil demand, especially in Europe, one of the main export markets. This trade uncertainty adds to existing concerns about the global economic recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic, further complicating the outlook for investors.

In summary, the oil market is in a state of constant tension, influenced by a combination of political, economic and geopolitical factors. The OPEC+ meeting will be a key event in determining the direction of the market in the coming months. Investors and analysts will be watching the decisions that are made, as they could have a significant impact on prices and the stability of the global energy market.

With so many factors at play, the future of the oil market is uncertain. What is clear, however, is that the decisions made in the coming days will have lasting repercussions. OPEC+'s ability to navigate these turbulent waters will be crucial to ensure market stability and avoid extreme fluctuations in oil prices.

55,Copper touches three-week low as economic uncertainty lingers,"Updates prices at 1600 GMT

May 22 (Reuters) - Copper prices hit a three-week low on Thursday and other base metals also eased as uncertainty persists over economic conditions and demand growth.

Benchmark copper CMCU3 on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 0.4% at $9,498 a metric ton by 1600 GMT. Earlier in the session, prices touched their lowest since May 1 at $9,223.20.

""A real state of paralysis has swept through metals markets,"" said Alastair Munro at broker Marex, pointing to the expiry of LME benchmark contracts this week.

Prices have been pressured by a sharp rise in Chinese copper inventoriesCU-STX-SGH last week, ending a three-week run of large withdrawals. Analysts and traders said that the rise was due to tepid copper demand in China and steady output from a growing smelting sector.

Also weighing on the market was the prospect of more supply after Freeport Indonesia's Manyar smelter in East Java resumed operations ahead of schedule after a fire last year. It is expected to produce copper cathode by the fourth week of June.

Investor sentiment, meanwhile, remained subdued in the face of a deteriorating U.S. fiscal outlook, with last week's Moodyï¿½ï¿½s downgrade fueling a growing ï¿½ï¿½Sell Americaï¿½ï¿½ narrative and leaving markets adrift.

Further dampening the market was a firmer U.S. dollar =USD after data showed U.S. business activity picked up in May, making dollar-priced metals more expensive for buyers with other currencies. USD/

LME lead CMPB3 was down 0.3% at $1,968 a ton after touching its lowest since May 9 at $1,947.50.

On-warrant LME lead inventories MPBSTX-TOTAL have surged by 91% over the past two days to 234,000 tons, their highest since December 2024.

Among other metals, aluminium CMAL3 dropped 0.6% to $2,456 a ton, nickel CMNI3 was down 0.6% at $15,510, tin CMSN3 fell 1.2% to $32,455, while zinc CMZN3 added 0.3% to $2,702.

CORN TENDER: Algerian state agency ONAB is holding a new international tender to purchase up to 240,000 metric tons of animal feed corn sourced from optional origins for shipment during July 1-15, European traders said. The holding of a new tender is believed to indicate that no significant purchase was made in ONAB's previous tender last week that sought up to 120,000 tons of corn. The agency has repeatedly issued corn tenders in recent weeks but participation was said to have been thin.

26,News: CBOT corn falls on benign weather in central US,"CHICAGO, May 30 (Reuters) - Chicago Board of Trade corn futures dipped on Friday on beneficial weather in the central U.S. and ample South American supplies, according to analysts.

CBOT July corn CN25 settled down 3 cents at $4.44 a bushel.

For the week, July corn CN25 fell 3.32%.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported weekly export sales of corn in the current marketing year at 916,700 metric tons, in line with trade expectations for 750,000-1,400,000 tons. USDA/EST

Relatively dry weather across the Midwest has recently favored remaining corn and soybean planting, while rains in the coming weeks will improve soil moisture for germination and early crop growth, according to weather forecaster Vaisala.

U.S. exporters sold 210,560 metric tons of corn to unknown destinations, of which 145,560 tons is for 2024/2025 delivery and 65,000 tons is for 2025/2026, according to the USDA.

The harvest in Argentina and the beginning of the safrinha corn harvest in Brazil means cheaper South American supplies are competing with U.S. exports, analysts said.

91,Oil Edges up after Trump Extends EU Trade Talks Deadline,"Asharq Al Awsat

Oil prices rose on Monday after US President Donald Trump extended a deadline for trade talks with the European Union, easing concerns about US tariffs on the bloc that could hit fuel demand.

Brent crude futures rose 39 cents, or 0.6%, to $65.17 a barrel by 0919 GMT while US West Texas Intermediate crude was up 33 cents, or 0.5%, at $61.86 a barrel.

""Trump's pivot, by postponing higher tariffs for the EU, and his comments on possible sanctions on Russia are moderately supporting crude prices today,"" UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

He added Monday's US Memorial Day holiday was likely to limit volumes of trade on the oil market.

Trump said he agreed to extend a deadline for trade talks with the European Union until July 9 after Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the bloc needed more time to strike a deal.

Trump separately said in a social media post that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""gone absolutely CRAZY"" by unleashing the largest aerial attack of the war on Ukraine and that he was weighing new sanctions on Moscow.

Brent and WTI traded higher on Friday as limited progress in US-Iran nuclear talks quashed expectations more Iranian oil will return to global markets and as US buyers covered positions ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend.

Prices on Friday also drew strength from data from energy services firm Baker Hughes that showed US firms cut the number of operating oil rigs by eight to 465 last week, the lowest since November 2021, raising the chance of tighter supplies in future.

The gains were capped by expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, could decide to increase output by another 411,000 barrels per day for July at a meeting on Sunday.

Reuters reported this month that the group could unwind the rest of its 2.2 million bpd voluntary production cut by the end of October, having already raised output targets by about 1 million bpd for April, May and June.

WHEAT - Down 1 to 2 cents per bushel

CBOT wheat futures fell on expectations of a large global wheat crop.

Agricultural consultancy Sovecon on Thursday raised its forecast for Russia's wheat exports for the 2025-2026 season by 1.1 million metric tons to 40.8 million tons, citing improved weather conditions for the harvest.

Russia plans to export 53.0 million metric tonnes of grain, including 44.5 million tonnes of wheat, in the 2024-2025 season, Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Patrushev said on Friday.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported U.S. wheat export sales losses of 128,800 metric tons, in line with analyst expectations.

CBOT July soft red winter wheat WN25 was last down 1/2 cent at $5.33-1/2 per bushel. K.C. July hard red winter wheat KWN25 was last up 1/4 cent at $5.32 per bushel. Minneapolis July spring wheat MWEN25 was last up 3-1/2 cents at $6.19 a bushel.


CORN - Down 1 cent to up 1 cent per bushel

Corn futures were mixed as traders weighed Brazil's large upcoming corn crop with large export sales reported on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The USDA reported export sales of corn for the current marketing year at 916,700 tons, in line with expectations.

U.S. exporters sold 210,560 metric tons of corn to unknown destinations.

CBOT July corn CN25 was last up 3/4 cent at $4.47-3/4 per bushel.


SOYBEANS - Down 4 to 6 cents per bushel

Soybean futures ticked lower to hold near Thursday's three-week low, curbed by expectations of ample supplies along with uncertainty over biofuel demand as the U.S. government considers waivers for oil refiners.

Traders are assessing a Reuters report that the White House is considering a plan to clear a record backlog of requests from small refineries for exemptions from U.S. biofuel laws.

The USDA reported export sales of soybeans clocked in at 146,000 tons, below a range of analyst expectations.

CBOT July soybeans SN25 were down 4-3/4 cents at $10.47 per bushel.

WHEAT - Down 8 to 9 cents per bushel

CBOT wheat futures fell for a third straight session on Tuesday, as the risk of crop-damaging weather ahead of the northern hemisphere harvest receded, reinforcing expectations of a well-supplied market.

Recent days have seen rain in dry parts of northern Europe, rainfall forecasts in drought-hit cropping regions in China, an upward revision to a wheat yield forecast in the European Union and an upgraded production estimate for Russia.

Traders were awaiting the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly crop report later on Tuesday to see if U.S. winter wheat conditions continued to improve last week.

Export demand for wheat remains tepid and export prices in top shipper Russia dipped last week.

CBOT July soft red winter wheat WN25 was last down 9-1/2 cents to $5.33 per bushel. K.C. July hard red winter wheat KWN25 was last down 11-1/4 cents to $5.27-1/2 a bushel. Minneapolis July spring wheat MWEN25 was last down 6 cents to $6.00-1/2 a bushel.


CORN - Down 1 to 2 cents per bushel

Corn futures lowered, curbed by a bounce in the dollar.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture in its weekly crop report Tuesday afternoon will release corn condition ratings and planting progress.

A lack of weather risks to the U.S. corn crop have weighed on prices.

CBOT July corn CN25 was last down 3/4 cent to $4.58-3/4 per bushel.


SOYBEANS - Up 5 to 6 cents per bushel

Soybeans rose under support from soyoil futures, which have rallied on hopes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will release new biofuel blending mandates.

CBOT July soybeans SN25 were last up 6-1/4 cents to $10.66-1/2 per bushel.

Work has started in irrigated areas of Mato Grosso's mid-north and west, as well as the west and center-west of Parana, AgRural said, adding that harvesting in other states is still in very early stages or expected to being in mid-June.

93,Oil prices edge up as Trump delays EU tariffs; oversupply worries cap gains,"Investing.com-- Oil prices edged higher in Asian trading on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump extended a deadline for his proposed reciprocal tariffs against the European Union.

However, gains were limited as oversupply worries persisted amid reports that the oil-procuring cartel, OPEC+, might hike production again in July.

As of 21:18 ET (01:18 GMT), Brent Oil Futures expiring in July rose 0.2% to $64.93 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 0.3% to $61.69 per barrel.

""We're likely to hear lots of noise this week ahead of the OPEC+ meeting on Sunday, 1 June, where the group will decide on output policy for July,"" ING analysts said in a note.

Trump extends deadline for 50% tariffs on EU to July

President Trump on Sunday announced an extension of the deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on European Union imports, moving it from June 1 to July 9.

This decision followed a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, during which both leaders agreed to intensify trade negotiations in the coming weeks.

The extension alleviated immediate concerns over a potential escalation in the U.S.-EU trade dispute, which had been unsettling global markets.

The postponement of tariffs is seen as a positive development for global economic stability, which in turn supports energy demand forecasts. Additionally, the move provides a window for diplomatic efforts to resolve trade tensions, further bolstering investor confidence.

Markets eye OPEC+ meeting, US-Iran nuclear talks to assess supply outlook

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, collectively known as OPEC+, are weighing the possibility of another production boost at their upcoming meeting on June 1, Bloomberg News reported last week.

The upcoming meeting is set to be a pivotal moment for the oil market, as the group's decision on production levels could have significant implications for global oil supply and prices.

According to the report, one option under consideration is a supply increase of 411,000 barrels per day in July, though no final decision has been made.

""We're assuming in our balance sheet that the group will agree to increase output by another 411k b/d in July. This should keep the market well supplied over the second half of this year,"" ING analysts wrote.

OPEC+ has been in the process of unwinding output cuts, with additions to the market in May and June.

Meanwhile, President Trump said he had ""very good"" talks with Iranian officials at the fifth round of nuclear negotiations over the weekend.

If the negotiations make progress or lead to an easing of U.S. sanctions, Iran could increase its crude oil exports, further underpinning a supply surplus scenario.

The soybean crop is now expected to hit 172 million metric tons, up from a previous forecast of 171.2 million tons, due to an increase in planted area and improvement in average yields, Datagro said.

21,News: UPDATE 1-AgRural bumps up forecasts for Brazil's 2024/25 corn and soybean crops,"SAO PAULO, June 2 (Reuters) - Agribusiness consultancy AgRural raised its forecasts for Brazil's 2024/25 corn and soybean crops on Monday, citing improved agricultural yields in several states.

The country's total corn production is set to hit 128.5 million metric tons this season, AgRural said, up from a previously estimated 124.8 million tons.

Farmers in Brazil's center-south region had harvested 1.3% of their second-corn areas by last Thursday, the consultancy said, up only 0.4 percentage points from the previous week owing to weather disruption to work in the fields.

""It could have advanced at a stronger pace but ended up limited by rain and lower temperatures,"" AgRural said, noting that some areas in Mato Grosso do Sul and Parana states experienced frosts, though damage appeared to be isolated.

The increased crop forecast was driven by higher second-crop yields in most areas, it noted, highlighting top grain-producing state Mato Grosso.

Brazil's second corn crop is planted after soybeans are harvested in the same areas and represents about 75% of national production each year.

AgRural also raised its forecast for Brazil's harvested soybean crop by 1.3 million tons to 169 million tons, citing some ""fine-tuning"" of yields in several states.",,2025-06-02 21:50:00.000 +0900,2025-06-02 21:50:00.000 +0900,Corn futures,TRUE,Reuters,TRUE
20,"News: CBOT corn ends lower on soy weakness, benign US crop weather","CHICAGO, June 2 (Reuters) - Chicago Board of Trade corn futures declined on Monday on spillover weakness from soybeans and as generally favorable crop weather bolstered early U.S. production prospects, traders said.

CBOT July corn CN25 settled down 5-3/4 cents at $4.38-1/4 per bushel after touching $4.37-3/4, its lowest since mid-May.

New-crop December corn CZ25 ended down 2-3/4 cents at $4.35-3/4 a bushel.

CBOT soybean futures sagged as trade tensions with China and uncertainty about U.S. biofuels policy threatened demand.

Ahead of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly U.S. crop progress report due later on Monday, analysts surveyed by Reuters on average expected the government to rate 69% of the U.S. corn crop in good to excellent condition, up a percentage point from last week.

Analysts on average estimated corn planting as 93% complete, up from 87% a week earlier.

Reminders of brisk corn export demand lent support. The USDA reported export inspections of U.S. corn in the latest week at 1,576,006 metric tons, above a range of trade expectations for 1,000,000 to 1,535,000 tons. USDA/I

However, ample South American supplies hung over the market. Brazilian consulting firm AgRural raised its estimate of the country's 2024/25 total corn harvest to 128.5 million metric tons, from its previous estimate of 124.8 million tons.

33,"News: GRAINS-Wheat, corn prices ease as dollar strengthens","LONDON, May 29 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures easedslightly on Thursday with a stronger dollar helping to keep a lid on prices despite lower-than-expected U.S. crop ratings.

Sluggish demand and expectations that a strong Northern Hemisphere harvest will keep the market well supplied also weighed on the market.

The rise in the dollar was triggered by a U.S. federal court blocking President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs from going into effect. .DXYMKTS/GLOB

A stronger dollar makes U.S. farm exports costlier for buyers with other currencies.

The most active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 was down 0.2% at $5.29-1/4 a bushel at1032 GMT.

The USDA on Tuesday rated only 45% of U.S. spring wheat in good to excellent condition, far below expectations, and showed a decline in the condition of U.S. winter wheat.

A coming flip to better weather should help the young wheat crop but the low rating sets the scene for market scares if unfavourable weather patterns set in, wrote Reuters columnist Karen Braun.

Elsewhere, crop news has been better. The European Commission on Wednesday slightly raised its forecast for usable production of common wheat in the EU in 2025/26.

A strong wheat harvest in India is rapidly replenishing stocks, meaning the country won't need to import.

While wheat stocks should rise in India, they won't in the rest of the world, analysts at Rabobank said, predicting CBOT prices would rise towards $6 a bushel over the course of 2025.

""A big question mark is whether India could allow some exports,"" Rabobank said. ""If India opens the export gates or Russian output ends up being bigger than expected following mild spring weather, we could see prices capped.""

CBOT corn prices Cv1 were also lower, slipping 0.8% to $4.47-1/2 a bushel, while soybeans Sv1 rose 0.2% to $10.50-1/2 a bushel.

Jordan's state grains buyer has issued an international tender to purchase up to 120,000 metric tons of animal feed barley, European traders said on Thursday.

29,"News: US Cash Grains-Soy, corn basis bids unchanged in quiet trade","CHICAGO, May 29 (Reuters) - Spot soybean and corn basis bids were steady as farmers focused on seeding the remainder of their crop, dealers said.

Chicago corn futures fell on Thursday as beneficial weather patterns moved through growing areas, analysts said.

Cheap South American crops also weighed on U.S. commodity prices.

The wheat basis rose at an Ohio elevator. Corn and soy bids were steady elsewhere.

The most active corn contract Cv1 on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) fell 4 cents to $4.47 per bushel.

Most active soybeans Sv1 settled up 3-1/4 cents at $10.51-3/4 a bushel.

61,Copper retreats on tariff uncertainty and firmer dollar,"Updates prices at 1625 GMT

LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - Copper prices lost ground on Tuesday, pressured by a firmer dollar and uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, retreating from their strongest in nearly two weeks after persistent problems at a large mine in Congo.

Three-month copper CMCU3 on the London Metal Exchange was down 0.2% at $9,595.50 a metric ton by 1625 GMT, after hitting its highest since May 14 at $9,640.

""We just don't know which way tariffs will go, how U.S.-European negotiations are going,"" said WisdomTree commodity strategist Nitesh Shah.

U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to drop his threat to impose 50% tariffs on European Union imports from next month gave new impetus to trade talks, the EU said on Monday.

U.S. Comex copper futures HGc3 slid 2% to $4.74 per lb, bringing the premium over LME copper to $855 a ton.

Also weighing on the market was the firmer dollar .DXY, making dollar-denominated assets more expensive for buyers using other currencies. FRX/

The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange SCFcv1 was down by 0.08% to 78,210 yuan ($10,878.36) a ton.

In top metals consumer China, end-user demand is gradually slowing and fundamentals could weaken as copper demand approaches its off season, said Chinese consultancy Everbright Futures.

Helping to cap losses in copper was news that Ivanhoe Mines IVN.TO had suspended its output forecast for this year after seismic activity at its giant mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo halted underground mining operations.

The DRC is the biggest copper producer in Africa.

""The suspension at the Kakula copper mine could remove about 150,000 tons of supply if shut for the remainder of the year. This is likely to weigh further on treatment charges and bring upside risk for copper prices,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Amy Gower said in a note.

Among other LME metals, aluminium CMAL3 climbed 0.9% to $2,484.50 a ton and zinc CMZN3 added 0.1% to $2,704, while lead CMPB3 slipped by 0.4% to $1,983, nickel CMNI3 retreated 1.2% to $15,400 and tin CMSN3 shed 1% to $32,500.

62,Industrial metals down pressured by stronger dollar,"Recasts, updates prices for Asia market close

May 28 (Reuters) - Industrial metals were subdued on Wednesday, weighed by a higher dollar, while improved risk appetite across financial markets following U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff respite offered support.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 was down 0.1% at $9,585 per metric ton by 0704 GMT.

The global refined copper market showed a 17,000 metric tons surplus in March, compared with a 180,000 metric tons surplus in February, the International Copper Study Group (ICSG) said in its latest monthly bulletin.

However, risk sentiment received a boost in the wider financial markets after Trump rolled back on Sunday his threat to impose 50% tariffs on imports from the EU next month, restoring a July 9 deadline to allow for talks.MKTS/GLOB

""Copper prices in the last two weeks have been trading in line with all sentiment in the global stock market. Trade optimism has lifted the US stock market and it has a kind of a spill over impact on copper prices as well,"" said Kelvin Wong, a senior market analyst, Asia Pacific at OANDA.

Also supporting risk sentiment was data on Tuesday that showed U.S. consumer confidence snapped five straight months of decline and improved in May amid the truce in the trade war between Washington and Beijing.

Among other London metals, aluminium CMAL3 eased 0.3% to $2,478 a ton, zinc CMZN3 fell 0.7% to $2,688, lead CMPB3 shed 0.4% to $1,977 and nickel CMNI3 weakened 1.6% to $15,165. Tin CMSN3 was down 2.3% to $31,840.

47,News: GRAINS-Corn and soy fall on Trump recommendations for EU tariffs,"Corn and soybeans fall on Trump recommendations for EU tariffs

Wheat dips on profit-taking

Corn also pressured by large global production forecast

Updates with U.S. trading; updates headline, byline, dateline; adds bullets

By Renee Hickman

CHICAGO, May 23 (Reuters) - Chicago corn and soy futures eased on Friday ahead of a long weekend in the U.S. as President Donald Trump posted on social media that he recommended a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union.

Wheat also fell as buying slowed after a rally earlier in the week, according to analysts.

The most active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade Sv1 was down 7-3/4 cents at $10.59-3/4 a bushel by 11:22 a.m. CST (1622 GMT), corn Cv1 fell 4 cents to $4.59 a bushel, and wheat Wv1 dipped 5-3/4 cents to $5.38-3/4 per bushel.

Ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend, which will keep U.S. markets closed on Monday, headlines continue to flow from the White House, said Arlan Suderman, Chief Commodities Economist at StoneX.

""That leaves traders a bit at risk,"" he said.

Corn and soybeans were both trading unchanged prior to Trump's social media post recommending steep tariffs on the EU, he said.

Fears of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods drove futures down afterward, Suderman added.

Favorable U.S. crop conditions and large harvests in Brazil were also keeping a lid on corn and soybean prices.

The International Grains Councilraised its forecast for 2025-26 global corn production by 3 million metric tons to 1.277 billion tons.

Wheat rose earlier in the week on concerns over the impact of previous adverse weather in Russia and China and an unexpected decline in U.S. wheat ratings.

Demand for competitively priced U.S. wheat also helped underpin prices, as illustrated by better-than-expected weekly U.S. wheat export sales data released on Thursday.

However, said Suderman, ""buying kind of dried up here at the end of the week as buyers stepped aside and there were people willing to sell the rally.""

32,News: RPT-COLUMN-What to make of surprisingly low US crop ratings: Braun,"NAPERVILLE, Illinois, May 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. corn crop has gotten off to a somewhat disappointing start in what is supposed to be a record producing season.

Meanwhile, U.S. spring wheat is experiencing its second-worst start to the growing season in history after this year?™s plantings dropped to a 55-year low.

What might these early figures mean for the growing season overall? How do they compare with past years? And where are the problem spots and near-term prospects for improvement?


SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS

The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Tuesday afternoon rated 68% of the U.S. corn crop in good-to-excellent (GE) condition in this season?™s initial rating, marking the lowest starting health since 2019.



That was well below analysts??average estimate of 73% GE, though initial condition reports from the Crop Watch producers over the weekend averaged out to a six-year low, at least.

A 68% GE is not all that bad. On average over the last three years, the initial U.S. corn score comes in around 72%. Additionally, the slower start may be explainable.

The unanimous feedback from the Crop Watch producers was that it has been too cold, cloudy and rainy, and the plants are not growing quickly. Hail, frosts, wind, rain and even a period of excessive heat recently stressed crops in the western Corn Belt, which was reported by Crop Watchers.

This showed up in USDA?™s data on Tuesday. Averaging initial corn conditions by state over the past three years, North Dakota and Ohio stand out. North Dakota at 48% GE is 24 percentage points below average and Ohio?™s 41% is 37 points below.

Conditions in top producer Iowa are 4 percentage points ahead of normal, Illinois is 7 points behind, South Dakota is down 16 points, Nebraska is down 2 points and Minnesota is 4 points behind.


OK OUTLOOK?

Three factors may help ease any concerns about current U.S. corn crop health.

The corn crop is only two-thirds emerged nationally, a lower-than-usual portion to coincide with the first condition scores. This allows for some play in the near-term figures, as newly emerged crops, if in good shape, could boost the overall score next week.

Although not necessarily unusual, less than 40% of corn in Ohio and North Dakota was emerged as of Sunday, possibly allowing for future improvement.

All Crop Watch producers last weekend expressed the dire need for heat and sun, and that should start arriving over the weekend after this week finishes out on the cooler, cloudy side.

The pattern might not necessarily be long-lasting, but even a short, warm, sunny spell in early June can go a long way for early crop growth.

U.S. corn was initially rated 65% GE in 2017, and calculations at the time pointed to near or below-trend yield probabilities. This caused the market to misjudge the crop potential all year, and the 2017 corn crop achieved a new record yield.

The 2017 crop was rated 60% GE by the end of July, not too huge of a change from the initial. So even though 60% would not be considered stellar by itself, the lack of large rating swings that season may have been telling.


WHEAT WOES

U.S. spring wheat was rated 45% GE as of Sunday, tied with 2021 as the second-lowest initial rating over the 40-year history. The worst was 34% in 1988.


Those two years are bad company, as they featured well-below-trend U.S. spring wheat yields as both seasons included drought. The 2025 crop is already starting in the hole as U.S. farmers intend to plant their smallest spring wheat area since 1970.

Some 60% of U.S. spring wheat was emerged by Sunday, comparable to 66% on the same date in 2021.

North Dakota, which produces half of the U.S. spring wheat crop, must remain on watch as only 37% of the wheat there is GE and 26% is considered poor or very poor. Recent cold and wet weather has battered the young wheat crop, so the coming flip to better weather may offer improvement opportunities.

Market analysts had expected the initial spring wheat conditions to come in at 71% GE, so the result was much more shocking than the one for corn.

But the lighter figures for both certainly set up the potential for market scares this summer if an unfavorable weather pattern were to set in.

57,London metals gain after Trump tariff reprieve,"Updates prices for Asia market close

SINGAPORE, May 26 (Reuters) - Prices of metals in London rose on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump rescinded his threat of a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union starting June 1, buoying market sentiment.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 gained 1.19% to $9,614 per metric ton by 0700 GMT, while the most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange SCFcv1 nudged 0.57% higher to 78,270 yuan ($10,909.62) a ton.

On Sunday, Trump agreed to extend his deadline for trade talks until July 9 from the June 1 limit he set on Friday after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc needed more time to ""reach a good deal"".

The supply of copper raw materials is currently tight, which may drive copper prices higher in the short term, said broker Hexun Futures.

Moreover, copper inventories in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange CU-STX-SGH fell 9% to 98,671 tons last week.

Still, tariff uncertainty may continue to restrict the performance of copper prices, said broker Everbright Futures.

Also supporting prices was a weaker U.S. dollar =USD, which sank 0.3% to 98.813, extending a 1.9% tumble from last week.USD/

SINGAPORE, May 27 (Reuters) - London metals edged lower on Tuesday amid weaker copper demand in top consumer China, although a softer dollar cushioned the fall.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 nudged 0.31% lower to $9,580.5 per metric ton by 0402 GMT.

107,Oil finishes down on possible OPEC+ output hike,"Brent and WTI down over 1% this week
OPEC+ could discuss bigger July output rise at Saturday meeting
Trade uncertainty continues after US appeals court decision
Changes headline, first paragraph, adds settlement prices, rig count

HOUSTON, May 30 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures fell on Friday as traders expected OPEC+ would decide on Saturday to boost oil output for July beyond previous forecasts.

Brent crude futures LCOc1settled down 25 cents, or 0.39%, at $63.90 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1finished down 15 cents, or 0.25%, at $60.79 a barrel, having earlier dropped more than $1 a barrel.

The Brent July futures contract is due to expire on Friday. The more liquid August contract LCOc2 was down 71 cents, or 1.12%, at $62.64 a barrel.

At these levels, the front-month benchmark contracts were headed for weekly losses over 1%.

Prices dipped into negative territory after Reuters reported that OPEC+ may discuss an increase in July output larger than the 411,000 barrels per day (bpd) rise that the group decided on for May and June.

""What OPEC+ is planning doesn't look particularly supportive for the oil market,"" said Matt Smith, Kpler's lead analyst for the Americas.

The potential OPEC+ output hike comes as the global surplus has widened to 2.2 million bpd, likely necessitating a price adjustment to prompt a supply-side response and restore balance, said JPMorgan analysts in a note, adding that they expected prices to remain within the current range before easing into the high $50s by year-end.

Phil Flynn, a senior analyst with Price Futures Group, said an online post on Truth Social by U.S. President Donald Trump that seemed to threaten more changes in tariff levels for Chinese imports also put pressure on crude prices.

""Trump's Truth Social message on China failing to observe a truce on tariffs also combined with the Reuters headline to push prices down,"" Flynn said.

Trump's tariffs were expected to remain in effect after a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated them on Thursday, reversing a trade court's decision a day earlier to put an immediate block on the sweeping duties.

U.S. energy firms this week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating for a fifth week in a row to the lowest since November 2021, energy services firm Baker Hughes BKR.O said in its closely followed report on Friday.

It was the first time since September 2023 that the number of rigs declined for five straight weeks.

Baker Hughes said this week's decline put the total count down by 37 rigs, or 6%, from this time last year.

Oil rigs fell by four to 461 this week, their lowest since November 2021, the company said. Gas rigs rose by one to 99.

51,News: Argentina downpours delay early wheat planting efforts,"BUENOS AIRES, May 22 (Reuters) - Recent heavy rains in Argentina have delayed the country's wheat planting, as well as its soybean and corn harvests, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said on Thursday in its weekly crop report.

Argentina's 2025/26 wheat planting season kicked off this week with just 3.4% of the planned 6.7 million hectares (16.6 million acres) planted so far.

The figure is 10 percentage points behind where it was at the same point last year, and four percentage points under the five-year average.

Argentina is a major global exporter of wheat.

Recent downpours of between 100 and 400 millimeters (4 and 16 inches) caused severe flooding in recent weeks and further soaked fields already waterlogged by showers earlier in the month.

At the same time, the report noted that excessively dry conditions in the country's north are contributing to wheat planting delays.

In April, the exchange forecast the 2025/26 wheat harvest would reach 20.5 million metric tons.

The rains have also delayed the 2024/25 soybean harvest by 20 percentage points in western parts of the heavily hit Buenos Aires province, the exchange said. The harvest as a whole is 74.3% complete.

The entity on Thursday held its estimate of 50 million tons for the soybean crop but warned earlier this week that production could face significant cuts due to harvest delays.

The also-delayed corn harvest is 38.8% complete, the exchange said, with production estimated at 49 million tons.

Argentina is the world's leading exporter of soybean oil and meal, and the third-largest exporter of corn.

36,"News: UPDATE 1-Taiwan?™s MFIG buys about 65,000 T corn from Brazil, traders say","Adds other offers, shipment details

HAMBURG, May 28 (Reuters) - Taiwan's MFIG purchasing group bought about 65,000 metric tons of animal feed corn expected to be sourced from Brazil in an international tender on Wednesday, European traders said.

Seller was believed to be trading house CJ International.

The yellow corn was purchased at an estimated premium of 165.90 U.S. cents a bushel cost and freight (c&f) included over the Chicago December 2025 corn contract CZ25, they said.

Reports reflect assessments from traders and further estimates of prices and volumes are still possible later.

Traders said the lowest offer for U.S. corn was believed to be 175.00 cents over Chicago December said to have been submitted by trading house Agrex for 65,000 tons.

Lowest offer for Argentine corn was 180.45 cents over Chicago December said to have been submitted by trading house ADM. Because of concerns about poor quality, Argentine corn would be accepted only if it is the lowest price offered and at least 4 cents per bushel below the next cheapest offer from other origins, traders said.

U.S. and Brazilian corn dominated the tender. Seven trading houses each offered 65,000 tons from the U.S., six each offered 65,000 tons from Brazil and two each offered 65,000 tons from Argentina. No offers were reported for South African corn.

Shipment was sought between July 21 and August 9 if the corn is sourced from the U.S. Gulf, Brazil or Argentina, traders said. If sourced from the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast or South Africa, shipment was sought on August 5-24.

In its last reported tender on April 29, the MFIG group bought about 65,000 tons of corn, expected to be sourced from the United States.

The deadline for submission of price offers in the tender is Wednesday, May 28, they said.

The new announcement is believed to indicate that no significant purchase was made in Algeria?™s previous tender for 80,000 tons of corn, which closed on May 21, they said.

Algeria has repeatedly issued corn tenders most weeks in May but participation was said to have been thin. Traders claimed delays in ship unloading in Algerian ports had generated painful financial charges for past sellers.

Terms in the latest tender had been changed to optional origins from Argentina or Brazil as the only sources in recent tenders after recent negotiations ended without significant purchases, traders said. This change had also been introduced in last week?™s tender.

""There is a debate in the market about whether these tenders should be regarded as real demand or price-checking,"" one trader said.

The latest tender seeks three consignments of 30,000 to 40,000 tons for shipment between June 15-30, traders said.

46,"News: RPT-UPDATE 1-India's monsoon rains arrive 8 days early, earliest in 16 years","By Rajendra Jadhav

MUMBAI, May 24 (Reuters) - Monsoon rains hit the coast of India's southernmost state of Kerala on Saturday, eight days earlier than usual, marking the earliest arrival in 16 years andproviding the promise of a bumper harvest and relief from a gruelling heatwave.

The monsoon, the lifeblood of the country's $4 trillion economy, delivers nearly 70% of the rain that India needs to water farms and replenish aquifers and reservoirs. Nearly half of India's farmland, without any irrigation cover, depends on the annual June-September rains to grow a number of crops.

Summer rains usually begin to lash Kerala around June 1 before spreading nationwide by mid-July, allowing farmers to plant crops such as rice, corn, cotton, soybeans and sugarcane.

The onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala on May 24 is its earliest onset since May 23, 2009, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday.

The monsoon has covered Kerala and parts of neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, as well as parts of the northeastern state of Mizoram, the IMD said.

Conditions are favourable for the monsoon's further spread into Goa, parts of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, the northeastern states, West Bengal, and the remaining parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the next 2 to 3 days.

Surplus pre-monsoon rainfall and an early monsoon onset will help farmers, especially in the southern and central states, to sow summer crops earlier than usual, said Ashwini Bansod, vice president for commodities research at Phillip Capital India, a Mumbai-based brokerage.

""Abundant soil moisture and early sowing could potentially boost crop yields,"" Bansod said.

Last year, the monsoon reached the coast of Kerala on May 30, and overall summer rains were the highest since 2020, supporting recovery from a drought in 2023.",,2025-05-26 12:15:00.000 +0900,2025-05-26 12:15:00.000 +0900,Corn futures,TRUE,Reuters,TRUE

US dollar weakens on fresh tariff threats
Canadian thermal oil sands operators shut production due to wildfires
Updates first paragraph to focus on OPEC+ plans, Canadian fires

NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed nearly 3% on Monday on supply concerns as producer group OPEC+ decided not to accelerate plans to hike output and wildfires in Canada's oil-producing province disrupted production.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled $1.85, or 2.95%, higher at $64.63 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 gained $1.73, or 2.85%, to $62.52.

Wildfires burning in Canada's oil-producing province of Alberta have affected about 7% of the country's overall crude oil output as of Monday, according to Reuters calculations.

At least two thermal oil sands operators south of the industry hub of Fort McMurray evacuated workers from their sites over the weekend and shut production as a precaution.

""The wildfires in Alberta are now starting to seep in,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York.

Also supporting prices, the U.S. dollar .DXY slipped across the board on Monday on worries that Trump's fresh tariff threats might hurt growth and stoke inflation.

A weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-priced commodities such as oil less expensive for buyers using other currencies.

Prices were also supported by a perception of increased geopolitical risk after Ukrainian drone strikes against Russia over the weekend, said Rystad Energy's Jorge Leon.

Meanwhile, mixed signals from Iran-U.S. talks kept market participants on edge. An Iranian diplomat said on Monday Iran was poised to reject a U.S. proposal to end a decades-old nuclear dispute. Delegations from the two countries made some progress after a fifth round of talks in Rome last month.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known collectively as OPEC+, decided on Saturday to raise output by 411,000 barrels per day in July, the third consecutive monthly increase of that amount, as it looks to wrestle back market share and punish members that have produced more than their quotas.

Sources familiar with OPEC+ talks said on Friday that the group could discuss an even larger increase.

Oil traders said the 411,000 bpd increase had already been priced into Brent and WTI futures.

Phil Flynn, a senior analyst with Price Futures Group, said investors had expected the oil-producing group to increase production by more than it did. ""I think they were caught the wrong way.""

Goldman Sachs analysts expect OPEC+ to implement a final 410,000 bpd production increase in August.

""Relatively tight spot oil fundamentals, beats in hard global activity data and seasonal summer support to oil demand suggest that the expected demand slowdown is unlikely to be sharp enough to stop raising production when deciding on August production levels on July 6,"" the bank said in a note.

Morgan Stanley analysts also said they expect 411,000 bpd to be added back each month up to a total of 2.2 million bpd by October.

""With this latest announcement, there is little sign that the pace of quota increases is slowing,"" the bank's analysts said.

""Risk premium has ramped up this week as the prospect of a Russia/Ukraine ceasefire as well as an Iranian nuclear deal now appear to have been pushed back for weeks if not months,"" analysts at energy advisory firm Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note.

Russia said work on trying to reach a settlement to end the war in Ukraine was extraordinarily complex and that it would be wrong to expect any imminent decisions but that it was waiting for Ukrainian reaction to its proposals.

Russia is a member of the OPEC+ group that includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, and was the world's second biggest producer of crude in 2024 behind only the U.S., according to U.S. energy data.

OPEC member Iran, meanwhile, was set to reject a U.S. nuclear deal proposal that would be key to easing sanctions on the major oil producer.

Iran was the third biggest producer of crude in OPEC behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq in 2024, according to U.S. energy data.

In Canada, wildfires burning in Alberta have affected more than 344,000 barrels per day of oil sands production, or about 7% of the country's overall crude output, according to Reuters calculations.



DEMAND GROWTH?

In Europe, Euro zone inflation eased below the European Central Bank's (ECB) target last month on surprisingly benign services costs, underpinning expectations for further policy easing even as global trade tensions fuel longer-term price pressures.

Central banks like the ECB use interest rates to keep inflation in check. Lower interest rates can spur economic growth and demand for oil by reducing consumer borrowing costs.

But, in the U.S., Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said higher inflation from U.S. import tariffs could become evident quickly, but he said it would take longer to see a tariff-induced economic slowdown.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), however, revised down its forecast for global economic growth as the fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war takes a bigger toll on the U.S. economy.

U.S. job openings increased in April, but layoffs posted their biggest rise in nine months, suggesting that labor market conditions were softening amid a dimming economic outlook because of tariffs.

The U.S. has asked countries to make their best offers on trade negotiations by Wednesday as U.S. officials ramp up efforts to deliver multiple agreements to Trump before a self-imposed deadline just five weeks away.



WEEKLY US CRUDE DRAW SEEN

Analysts forecast energy firms pulled about 1.0 million barrels of crude from U.S. stockpiles last week, reducing inventories for a second week in a row.

That compares with an increase of 1.2 million barrels during the same week last year and an average decrease of 2.3 million barrels over the past five years (2020-2024).

117,Saudi Arabia lowers July oil prices for Asia after,"July Arab Light OSP falls by 20 cents/bbl
Price cut smaller than expected
Higher Saudi demand may limit export, analyst says
Recasts paragraph 1, adds comments in paragraph 6

June 4 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, on Wednesday lowered its July prices for Asian buyers after OPEC+ hiked output for a fourth month although the price cut was smaller than expected.

Saudi Arabia's state firm Aramco 2223.SE cut the official selling price for the flagship Arab light crude it sells to Asia for July to $1.20 a barrel above the Oman/Dubai average, 20 cents lower than June and the lowest since May.

Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia are raising output. Eight OPEC+ countries on Saturday agreed to another big increase of 411,000 bpd for July, having increased output by the same amount in May and June.

However, Saudi Arabia's 20-cent price cut was smaller than the 40-cent to 50-cent reduction expected in a Reuters survey.

""A smaller reduction was likely due to strong domestic crude burn in Saudi Arabia and refinery runs that could limit barrels available for export,"" said Richard Jones, an analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects.

The Middle East typically burns crude and high-sulphur fuel oil for power between June and August, for the peak demand season. Analysts expected Saudi to burn more crude oil for power generation this summer.

Saudi crude OSPs set the price trend for other grades exported by Iran, Kuwait and Iraq, affecting about 9 million barrels per day of crude bound for Asia.

66,London copper inches higher after US court blocks Trump's tariffs,"May 29 (Reuters) - London copper prices edged higher on Thursday, buoyed by upbeat market sentiment after a U.S. federal court blocked President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs from going into effect, although a stronger dollar kept gains in check.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 rose 0.2% to $9,577.50 per metric ton, as of 0151 GMT.

The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) SCFcv1 was steady at 78,010 yuan ($10,829.01)per ton.

A U.S. trade court on Wednesday blocked Trump's tariffs from going into effect in a sweeping ruling that the president overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from nations that sell more to the United States than they buy.

This boosted risk sentiment in the wider financial markets, while also triggering a surge in the U.S. dollar index .DXY, which rose to highest level in more than a week. MKTS/GLOB

A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated assets more expensive to holders of other currencies. USD/

Chile's state copper commission Cochilco raised its average copper price forecast for this year and next on Wednesday, citing an improved global outlook following a pause in the tariff war between the United States and China.

Copper, used in power and construction, is up 5% so far this month as global trade tensions eased compared to April when U.S. President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs.

Among other London metals, aluminium CMAL3 eased 0.1% to $2,466 a ton, zinc CMZN3 edged 0.1% higher to $2,690.50, lead CMPB3 was little changed at $1,981.50 and nickel CMNI3 gained 0.7% to $15,115. Tin CMSN3 was down 0.3% to $31,540.

SHFE aluminium SAFcv1 rose 0.1% to 20,170 yuan a ton, lead SPBcv1 was up 0.2% at 16,785 yuan, nickel SNIcv1 fell 0.9% to 120,070 yuan, while zinc SZNcv1 was steady at 22,360 yuan and tin SSNcv1 fell 1.1% to 259,020 yuan.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday rated 69% of the U.S. corn crop in good to excellent condition, up 1 percentage point from the previous week. Planting was 93% complete, matching the five-year average pace.

Corn Belt crop weather was generally favorable. Rains were crossing portions of eastern Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin on Tuesday.

Brent futures hit a session low of $63.86 per barrel, while US crude futures reached a low of $60.60 per barrel.

89,Energy surplus on the decline: how the fall in oil prices affects the Central Bank,"The recent drop in international oil prices has begun to affect the national energy trade balance, according to the Argentine Trade Exchange (ICA) report published by INDEC. In April, energy exports reached US$851 million, representing a 10% decrease compared to the same month of the previous year. This drop is mainly attributed to a 14% reduction in international prices, despite a 4.5% increase in exported quantities.

The energy trade balance remained in surplus at US$461 million, although lower than the US$579 million recorded in April 2024. Exports of crude petroleum oils and naphtha excluding petrochemicals decreased by 9.2% and 34.8%, respectively. On the other hand, imports grew by 17.4%, driven by higher purchases of diesel and gasoline excluding aviation.

The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil, the country's benchmark, fell from US$76 to US$66 in April, and is currently below US$65, far from last year's average of US$80. If this trend continues, it is estimated that the country could close the year with an energy trade surplus similar to that of 2024, around US$6 billion, far from the initial projections that suggested a higher amount.

This situation represents a challenge for the Central Bank, which was counting on higher foreign currency income from energy exports to strengthen international reserves. The fall in oil prices and the increase in imports could limit the capacity to accumulate reserves, affecting the country's financial stability.

LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - World shares gained on Tuesday as investors weighed up the latest tariff-related news, while long-dated U.S. Treasury yields were set for their biggest one-day fall since mid-April, mirroring a steep price rally in super-long Japanese debt.

After a weekend call with the European Commission's president, U.S. President Donald Trump paused until July 9 his threatened tariff of 50% on goods entering the United States from the European Union.

European shares .STOXX added 0.5%, supported by defence stocks, with UK shares .FTSE climbing 0.8% to their highest in three weeks, following a holiday at the start of the week.

Wall Street shares, which also saw no trade on Monday due to a U.S. holiday, were set for solid gains too. S&P futures ESc1 were up 1.4%.

""Markets are getting more accustomed to Trump's threats and now partly assume the full threat won't immediately materialise,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote. ""There is certainly fear fatigue.""

Meanwhile, the yield on 30-year U.S. TreasuriesUS30YT=RR, which affects U.S. government borrowing costs to home mortgage rates, fell as much as 8 basis points to 4.9572%, their lowest in a week.

The 30-year yields - at the epicentre of the market sell-off in April following Trump's initial raft of tariffs - are still just below 5%, near their highest since October 2023.

The move mirrored a near-20 basis point fall in yields for Japanese 30-year debt JP30YTN=JBTC that came after a Reuters report on Tuesday that Tokyo will consider trimming issuance of the super-long bonds, after recent sharp rises in yields.

""Debt sustainability is again creeping into investors minds,"" regarding heavily indebted Japan, said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro for ING Research. ""That is a spillover from the concerns about the U.S.""

A major focus for investors this week will be results from NvidiaNVDA.O on Wednesday, where the AI bellwether is expected to report a 66% jump in first-quarter revenue.

Speeches from a slew of Federal Reserve policymakers and Friday's U.S. core PCE price index are also due, which could provide clues on the outlook for U.S. rates.

In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.4%, although Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index .HSI outperformed with a gain of 0.4%.



LOSS OF CONFIDENCE

The dollar edged up 0.4% against a basket of currencies =USD as investors took comfort from Trump's tariff delay. Still, it was still heading for a fifth straight month of declines, which would mark its longest such losing streak since 2017.

The euro EUR=EBS fell 0.4%, near a one-month high at $1.134725, while the yen JPY=EBS weakened 0.6% to 143.71 per dollar.

Trump's flip-flops on tariffs and concerns over the worsening U.S. deficit outlook have undermined sentiment towards U.S. assets and in turn been a drag on the dollar.

""A U.S. dollar regime change could be in the making in the long term after it appears to have peaked recently,"" said David Meier, an economist at Julius Baer.

""Erratic U.S. policymaking, the tense fiscal situation, and large external indebtedness, against the backdrop of the twin deficit, suggest that a weaker USD is the route of least resistance.""

And as the dollar loses some of its safe-haven appeal, investors have instead sought alternatives such as gold, sending prices to record highs this year XAU=.

Still, gold fell 1.4% to $3,298 an ounce as the dollar strengthened. GOL/

Oil prices were little changed on increasing expectations that members of OPEC+ will decide to increase their output at a meeting later this week.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 clawed back losses and was last flat at $64.71 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 fell 0.1% to $61.46 a barrel.

100,Oil prices climb as US court blocks Trump tariffs,"TOKYO, May 29 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday after a U.S. court blocked President Donald Trump's tariffs from taking effect, while the market was watching out for potential new U.S. sanctions curbing Russian crude flows and an OPEC+ decision on hiking output in July.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 climbed 81 cents, or 1.25%, to $65.71 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 advanced by 83 cents, or 1.34%, to $62.62 a barrel at 0102 GMT.

A U.S. trade court on Wednesday ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board tariffs on imports from nations that sell more to the United States than they buy.

The ruling buoyed risk appetite across global markets which have been on edge about the impact of the levies on economic growth, but analysts said the relief may only be temporary given the administration has said it will appeal.

""But for now, investors get a breather from the economic uncertainty they love to loathe,"" said Matt Simpson, an analyst at City Index in Brisbane.

On the supply front, there are concerns about potential new sanctions on Russian crude. At the same time, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together called OPEC+, could agree on Saturday to accelerate their oil production hikes in July.

With Russian oil so far overall showing relative resistance to the sanctions, imposed over Moscow's war on Ukraine, ""it is hard to be convinced that any new U.S. sanctions on Russia will meaningfully dent Russia's oil exports,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar said in a note.

Adding to supply risks, Chevron CVX.N has terminated its oil production and a number of other activities in Venezuela, after its key license was revoked by U.S. President Donald Trump's government in March.

Venezuela in April cancelled cargoes scheduled to Chevron citing payment uncertainties related to U.S. sanctions. Chevron was exporting 290,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil or over a third of the country's total before that.

""From May through August, the data points to a constructive, bullish bias with liquids demand set to outpace supply,"" Mukesh Sahdev, Global Head of Commodity Markets at Rystad Energy, said in a note, as he expects demand growth outpacing supply growth by 0.6 million to 0.7 million bpd.

Later on Thursday, investors will be watching for the weekly reports from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy.

U.S. crude oil and distillate inventories likely rose last week while gasoline stockpiles likely fell, an extended Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.

NEW YORK, May 28 (Reuters) - Oil prices gained more than 1% on Wednesday on supply concerns as OPEC+ agreed to leave their output policy unchanged and as the U.S. barred Chevron CVX.N from exporting Venezuelan crude.

Investors previously anticipated members of OPEC+ would agree to a production increase later this week.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up 81 cents, or 1.26%, to $64.90 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 gained 95 cents, or 1.56%, to stand at $61.84 a barrel.

OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, did not change output policy. It agreed to establish a mechanism for setting baselines for its 2027 oil production.

Most oil-producing countries at the meeting do not have flexibility to adjust their output, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. ""They were hoping to slow the pace of production increases and stop the slide in price. But that's not the way it panned out,"" he added.

A separate meeting on Saturday of eight OPEC+ countries is expected to decide on an increase in oil output for July.

Goldman Sachs analysts saw the group of eight keeping production steady after the July hike.

""However, we see the risks to our OPEC8+ supply path as skewed to the upside, especially if compliance doesn't improve or if hard demand data surprise further to the upside,"" they added.

Coming demand for the summer driving season is significant, and with non-OPEC+ crude output flat in the first half of the year, coupled with risks of Canadian wildfires hurting supply, the call on crude is stronger from OPEC+, said Janiv Shah, vice president of oil commodity markets analysis at Rystad Energy.

On Wednesday, Chevron CVX.N terminated the oil production, service and procurement contracts it had to operate in Venezuela, but it plans to retain its direct staff in the country, sources said.

Both benchmarks ticked up in the previous session on concerns of tighter supply after the U.S. barred Chevron from exporting crude from Venezuela under a new authorization on its assets there.

Analysts also said prices could respond positively if there was progress on global trade talks or resolving U.S.-Iranian friction.

Iran's nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami said on Wednesday it might allow the U.N. nuclear watchdog to send U.S. inspectors to visit nuclear sites if Tehran's talks with Washington succeed.

LONDON/MOSCOW, May 30 (Reuters) - OPEC+ may discuss an increase in oil output for July at its meeting on Saturday larger than the 411,000 barrels per day (bpd) increases it made for May and June, sources familiar with OPEC+ talks told Reuters.

Eight OPEC+ countries have been raising output more rapidly than earlier planned, even though the extra supply has weighed on prices. The strategy of group leaders Saudi Arabia and Russia is partly to punish over-producing allies and to win back market share, Reuters has reported.

On Saturday, the eight members may decide to increase output by 411,000 bpd for July, OPEC+ sources have told Reuters. Two more sources familiar with OPEC+ talks and two OPEC+ delegates said they could also discuss a larger increase.

Kazakhstan's statement on Thursday that it won't cut production has sparked debate in OPEC+, some of the sources said on Friday, with one saying that this factor may tilt discussions towards a larger output hike on Saturday.

All sources declined to be identified by name due to the sensitivity of the matter. OPEC and authorities in Russia and Saudi Arabia did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.

United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, asked about the plan for July output on Tuesday, said OPEC+ was doing its best to balance the oil market and needed to be mindful of rising demand.

Kazakhstan has been pumping hundreds of thousands of barrels over its OPEC+ target for months, a factor that has angered other OPEC+ members and helped sway a decision by the group to proceed with plans to hike output in April, sources said at the time.

OPEC+ wants it to compensate by making further cuts, but on Thursday Russia's Interfax news agency cited Kazakhstan's deputy energy minister as saying that the country has informed OPEC that it does not intend to reduce production.

Oil prices LCOc1 fell to a four-year low in April below $60 per barrel after OPEC+ said it was accelerating its output hike in May and as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs raised concerns about global economic weakness. Since then prices have recovered to about $65.

OPEC+, which includes OPEC members and allies such as Russia, has made deep output cuts since 2022 to support the market. Eight members of the group have been increasing production since April to unwind some of those cuts.

OPEC+ supply rises weigh on sentiment
Persistent tariff tensions stalk market
New throughout, updates prices, market activity and comments

HOUSTON, June 4 (Reuters) - Oil prices settled down just over 1% on Wednesday after U.S. data showed surprisingly large build in gasoline and diesel inventories, swelling fuel supplies with OPEC+ planning more output and trade tensions clouding the energy demand outlook.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 closed down 77 cents, or 1.2%, at $64.86 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 settled 56 cents, or 0.9% lower at $62.85.

U.S. gasoline stocks swelled by 5.2 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 600,000 barrels.

Distillate stockpiles rose by 4.2 million barrels compared with expectations for a rise of 1 million barrels.

Crude inventories dropped by 4.3 million barrels. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a draw of 1 million barrels.

""The report is in my view bearish, due to large builds in refined products,"" Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst with UBS.

""There was a strong increase in refinery demand for crude, resulting in a large crude draw. But post-Memorial Day, the strong supply increase with weaker implied demand resulted in large refined product inventory increases,"" he added.

Plans by OPEC+ producers to increase output by 411,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July were also weighing on investors.

On Tuesday, both benchmarks climbed about 2% to a two-week high, driven by worries about supply disruptions and expectations that OPEC member Iran would reject a U.S. nuclear deal proposal key to easing sanctions.

Russia posted a 35% decline in May oil and gas revenue, which could make Moscow more resistant to further OPEC+ output hikes, as such moves weigh on crude prices.

On Tuesday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut its global growth forecast as the fallout from Trump's trade policies takes a bigger toll on the U.S. economy, which would in turn impact oil demand.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are likely to speak this week, days after Trump accused China of violating a deal to roll back tariffs and trade curbs.

U.S. economic activity has declined and higher tariff rates have put upward pressure on costs and prices in the weeks since Federal Reserve policymakers last met to set interest rates, the central bank said in its latest snapshot of the economy.

Geopolitical tensions continued to escalate. Russian President Vladimir Putin told Trump that he must respond to high-profile Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia's nuclear-capable bomber fleet and a deadly bridge bombing that Moscow blamed on Kyiv.

""Overall, we see limited upside potential amid ongoing concerns about a supply glut and softening demand growth,"" analyst Ole Hansen at Saxo Bank said in a note.

Meanwhile, production operations in Canada, some of which was shut-in due to wildfires, were restarting on Wednesday.

Canadian Natural Resources CNQ.TO said it has restarted its Jackfish 1 oil sands site in northern Alberta after determining wildfires in the region were a safe distance away.

Wildfires in Canada had reduced the country's output by some 344,000 bpd, according to Reuters calculations on Tuesday.

May 30 (Reuters) - Industrial metals fell on Friday as the dollar strengthened and market optimism faded following a court ruling that reinstated the broadest tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 was down 0.2% at $9,549.50 per metric ton, as of 0707 GMT.

The red metal, used in power and construction, has still gained nearly 5% so far this month, and is set for its best month since September 2024.

The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) SCFcv1 shed 0.5% to 77,600 yuan ($10,792.02) per ton.

LME aluminium CMAL3 fell 0.3% to $2,442 a ton, zinc CMZN3 slipped 0.6% to $2,658.50, lead CMPB3 dipped 0.5% to $1,952 and nickel CMNI3 fell 0.1% to $15,355. Tin CMSN3 dropped 1.7% to $30,650.

""Market rose yesterday due to optimism that the court was able to block Trump tariffs, but the rally faded later as the appeals court suspended that verdict,"" a metals trader in Singapore said.

A federal appeals court temporarily reinstated the most sweeping of Trump's tariffs on Thursday, a day after a U.S. trade court ruled that the president had exceeded his authority in imposing the duties and ordered an immediate block on them.

88,Brent crude oil down 1.45% on Trump's threats to raise tariffs on the EU,"London, May 23 (EFE) - The barrel of Brent crude for delivery in July was down 1.45% this afternoon on the London futures market compared to the previous day's close, given the threat of US President Donald Trump to impose a 50% tariff on products from the European Union (EU) from June 1.

Europe's benchmark North Sea crude was trading at $63.50 on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) at 12:12 a.m. GMT, down from $64.44 at the previous day's close.

Trump relaunched his tariff battle with the EU on Friday by saying that negotiations with the EU bloc ""are not bearing fruit,"" which is why he recommended imposing the 50% tariff.

""The European Union, created for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the U.S. in trade, has been very difficult to manage (...) Our talks with them are not bearing fruit!

149,Gold rises as traders await US data; silver hits over 13-year high,"US non-farm payroll data due on Friday
Trump says Fed chief must lower interest rate
Silver hits highest level in more than 13 years
Updates headline, prices for EMEA session

June 5 (Reuters) - Gold held its ground on Thursday as investors looked forward to U.S. non-farm payrolls data due later this week to assess the U.S. interest rate path, while silver prices rose above the key $35 per ounce level for the first time since October 2012.

Spot gold XAU= was up 0.6% at $3,395.29 an ounce, as of 1147 GMT. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 rose 0.6% to $3,419.70.

""I would say that the path of least resistance remains to the upside, despite today's sort of flat mode for gold trading. But I think this is more due to traders being in wait-and-see mode ahead of non-farm payrolls,"" said Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at brokerage firm ActivTrades.

Wednesday's ADP National Employment Report revealed U.S. private payrolls increased far less than expected in May. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday called for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates.

""I think that a weakening in the U.S. labor market will increase bets on a dovish Fed, so on the Fed cutting interest rates, (which) would be positive for gold,"" Evangelista added.

Gold, a safe-haven asset during times of political and economic uncertainty, tends to thrive in a low-interest-rate environment.

Meanwhile, spot silver XAG= jumped 2.5% to $35.83 per ounce, its highest level since February 2012.

Silver's ""recent underperformance against gold because of economic concerns, given that 70% of silver usage is industrial, it looks that there could be some ratio trading going on now that it has dipped below the 100 level,"" StoneX analyst Rhona O'Connell said.

The gold-silver ratio, denoting how many ounces of silver one ounce of gold can buy, is used by the market to gauge future trends as it indicates silver's current performance against its historical correlation with gold.

Platinum XPT= rose 3.6% to $1,123.88, its highest level since March 2022, and palladium XPD= was up 1.8% at $1,018.38.

""Tangible assets with limited supply such as gold, silver, platinum and copper should be part of a broad portfolio in order to mitigate any economic fallout from geopolitical events, government mismanagement of debt and rising inflation threat"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.

Trump on Wednesday said the nation's debt ceiling should be eliminated, saying he agreed with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren's view on the subject.

98,Russian finance minister returns to idea of adjusting oil price budget rule,"Adds details and Siluanov quote in paragraphs 1, 4-8

May 28 (Reuters) - Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday an adjustment to the $60 oil cut-off price for Russia's budget rule should be considered, marking a potential policy shift that could impact Moscow's ability to raise spending and build up cash reserves.

Under the budget rule, the Finance Ministry sells foreign currency from its rainy-day National Wealth Fund to make up for any shortfall in revenue from oil and natural gas exports, or makes purchases in the event of a surplus.

While Siluanov had previously spoken in favour of the cut-off price being changed, he recently ruled out an adjustment for the next three-year budget.

Responding to a lawmaker's question about Russia's depleting reserves on Wednesday, he appeared to change tack once more, saying the issue would be discussed when formulating budget policy.

""We need to think about whether, when preparing the new budget for the medium-term, we should look at the cut-off price level ... to what extent it corresponds today to levels that allow us to ensure not only the preservation of the National Wealth Fund, but also its replenishment,"" Siluanov said.

Russia's fiscal buffers have dwindled since its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Moscow dipping into the wealth fund to finance budget deficits and support state-owned companies. The fund's liquid assets stood at $40.4 billion on May 1, down from $112.7 billion before the invasion.

High prices for oil, the cornerstone of Russia's export-focused economy, enable Russia to set funds aside, but with Brent futures having dropped to about $60 a barrel and Urals crude even lower, Moscow's finances are under pressure.

A lower cut-off price would allow Russia to save more petrodollars, but that also implies reduced expenditure, which, as analysts have noted, may be hard to achieve with Moscow spending heavily on the war in Ukraine.

Wednesday's meeting is set to adopt a mechanism for deciding OPEC+'s baselines for 2027 production, two other sources said.

LONDON/MOSCOW, May 28 (Reuters) - OPEC+ may discuss issues around its baselines for 2027 production at its meeting on Wednesday, two delegates from the group said, while separate talks due on Saturday could agree a further accelerated oil output hike for July.

The group, which includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, has been discussing new baselines - production levels from which each member makes cuts or increases - for the last few years.

Baseline issues are controversial because some members such as the United Arab Emirates and Iraq have increased their oil production capacity, pressing the case for higher quotas, while others such as African members have seen declines.

The 22-member group on Wednesday is likely to ask OPEC headquarters to prepare a mechanism to help establish the baseline assessment for 2027, one of the delegates said. That meeting is not expected to change output policy, OPEC+ sources have said.

On Saturday, the eight OPEC+ members who are in the process of gradually raising output are set to meet and may agree an output hike for July of 411,000 barrels per day, the same as in May and June, the delegates said.

OPEC+ has agreed three layers of output cuts since 2022. Two of these are in place until the end of 2026 and one is currently being unwound by the eight members.

The 2027 baselines in theory could feature in production policy when all output cuts currently in place expire.

In April, eight OPEC+ members began to unwind the group's most recent layer of output cuts, and for May and June made larger-than-expected hikes of 411,000 barrels per day.

OPEC+ sources have told Reuters the eight members at their meeting on Saturday may decide on a similar 411,000 bpd output hike for July. All sources declined to be identified by name due to the sensitivity of the matter.

Oil LCOc1 fell to a four-year low in April below $60 per barrel after OPEC+ said it was accelerating its output hike in May and as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs raised concerns of global economic weakness. Since then it has recovered to about $65.

Earlier this month, sources told Reuters that the eight countries, in addition to another 411,000 bpd output hike for July, may unwind the remainder of the most recent cut by the end of October.

LONDON/MOSCOW, May 31 (Reuters) - The worldï¿½ï¿½s largest group of oil producers, OPEC+, stuck to its guns on Saturday with another big increase of 411,000 barrels per day for July as it looks to wrestle back market share and punish over-producers.

Having spent years curbing production - more than 5 million barrels a day (bpd) or 5% of world demand - eight OPEC+ countries made an modest output increase in April before tripling it for May, June and now July.

They are spurring production despite the extra supply weighing on crude prices as group leaders Saudi Arabia and Russia seek to win back market share as well as punish over-producing allies such as Iraq and Kazakhstan.

""Todayï¿½ï¿½s decision only goes to show that market share is on top of the agenda. If price will not get you the revenues you want, they are hoping that volume will,"" said analyst Harry Tchilinguirian of Onyx Captal Group.
The eight countries held an online meeting on Saturday to set July production. They also discussed other options, an OPEC+ delegate said. On Friday, sources familiar with OPEC+ talks had said they could discuss an even larger hike.







In a statement OPEC+ cited a ""steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories"" as its reasoning for the July increase.

OPEC+ pumps about half of the world's oil and includes OPEC members and allies such as Russia.

Its increased supply is weighing on crude prices, squeezing all producers, but some more than others, including a key group of rivals - U.S. shale producers, analysts say.

""Three strikes from OPEC+, and none were softballs. May warned, June confirmed, and July fires a shot across the bow,"" said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad and a former OPEC official.

Since April, the OPEC+ eight have now made or announced increases totalling 1.37 million bpd, or 62% of the 2.2 million bpd they aim to add back to the market.

Higher summer oil demand favours increasing output at this time, OPEC+ officials including Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak have said.

""The oil market remains tight indicating it can absorb additional barrels, as the effective increase should be smaller as several of the eight countries are overproducing, and demand is seasonally rising,"" said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at UBS.

Algeria was among a small number of nations that requested a pause in the output hikes on Saturday, a source familiar with the matter said.

Oil prices LCOc1 fell to a four-year low in April, slipping below $60 per barrel after OPEC+ said it was tripling its output hike in May and as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs raised concerns about global economic weakness. Prices closed just below $63 on Friday.

Global oil demand is expected to grow by an average of 775,000 bpd in 2025, according to a Reuters poll of analysts published on Friday, while the International Energy Agency in its latest outlook saw an increase of 740,000 bpd.

Besides the 2.2 million bpd cut that the eight members started to unwind in April, OPEC+ has two other layers of cuts that are expected to remain in place until the end of 2026.

Updates prices throughout

SYDNEY/LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - Stocks and the dollar fell on Monday as U.S.-China trade tensions bubbled and investors turned defensive ahead of U.S. jobs data and a widely expected cut in European interest rates.

Shares in steelmakers, which export metal to the United States, dropped in reaction to President Donald Trump's threat late on Friday to double tariffs on imported steel and aluminium to 50%, starting June 4. The move drew criticism from European Union negotiators.

Speaking on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump would soon speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping to iron out a dispute over critical minerals.

Beijing then forcefully rejected Trump's trade criticism, suggesting a call might be some time coming.

With tensions rising again over tariffs and trade, sentiment looked fragile in Europe, where the STOXX 600 .STOXX fell 0.2% on the day and euro zone government bonds sold off, while the euro benefited from an investor push out of dollar holdings.

""The flip-flopping on trade policy looks set to continue and it appears the uncertainty this creates does not bother President Trump at all. That is likely to give investors the reason to renew selling of the U.S. dollar,"" MUFG strategist Derek Halpenny said.

The dollar has lost 9% in value against a basket of six major currencies so far this year. The index =USD was last down 0.53% on the day at 98.83.

White House officials also continued to play down a court ruling that Trump had overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on imports from U.S. trading partners.

Investors will be watching for signs to indicate whether Trump will go ahead with the 50% tariff on Wednesday or back off as he has often done before.

Safe-haven assets found plenty of demand on Monday, with the likes of the Japanese yen and Swiss franc staging a robust rally, as did gold.

There was some speculation about what Ukraine's astonishing attack on Russian air bases might mean for peace talks resuming on Monday.

In Poland, nationalist opposition candidate Karol Nawrocki narrowly won a presidential election, delivering a major blow to the centrist government's efforts to cement Warsaw's pro-European orientation.



TARIFF TURBULENCE

In U.S. markets, S&P 500 futures ESc1 fell 0.3%, while Nasdaq futures NQc1 lost 0.4%, suggesting a retreat at the opening bell later. The S&P had climbed 6.2% in May, while the Nasdaq rallied 9.6% on hopes that final import levies will be far lower than the sky-high levels initially touted by Trump.

Front-running the tariffs has already caused wild swings in the U.S. economy, with a contraction in the first quarter likely turning into a jump this quarter as imports fall back.

The Atlanta Fed GDPNow estimate is running at an annualised 3.8% for April-June, though analysts assume this will slow sharply in the second half of the year.

Data this week on U.S. manufacturing and jobs will offer a timely reading on the pulse of activity, with payrolls expected to rise 130,000 in May and unemployment to remain at 4.2%.

A rise in unemployment is one of the few developments that could get the Federal Reserve to start thinking of easing again, with investors having largely given up on a cut this month or next. 0#USDIRPR

A move in September is given an approximately 75% chance, though Fed officials have stopped well short of endorsing such pricing.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Monday that cuts remain possible later this year as he saw downside risks to economic activity and employment and upside risks to inflation from the tariffs.

The Senate will this week start considering a tax-and-spending bill that will add an estimated $3.8 trillion to the federal government's $36.2 trillion in debt.

Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank is considered almost certain to cut its rates by a quarter point to 2.0% on Thursday, while markets will be sensitive to guidance on the chance of another move as early as July. 0#EURIRPR

The Bank of Canada meets Wednesday and markets imply a 76% chance it will hold rates at 2.75%, while sounding dovish on the future given the tariff-fuelled risk of recession there.

On Monday, the dollar fell 0.9% on the yen to below 143 JPY=EBS, and was down 0.6% to 0.818 Swiss francs CHF=EBS. The euro was up 0.55% to $1.1412 EUR=EBS, around its highest since late April.

In commodity markets, gold rallied 2% to $3,356 an ounce XAU=, having lost 1.9% last week. GOL/

Brent crude oil LCOc1rose by almost 4% to $65 a barrel after OPEC+ decided to increase output in July by the same amount as in each of the prior two months, a relief to some who had feared an even bigger increase. O/R

ADNOC set its August export forecast of the light Murban grade at 1.705 million barrels per day (bpd), according to a company report on Saturday.

That is 65,000 bpd lower than the 1.77 million bpd forecast previously.

ADNOC also lowered the forecast for September 2025 to May 2026 by 100,000-177,000 bpd while keeping forecast volumes for June and July 2025 unchanged.

ADNOC said that the reduction is primarily because of feedstock optimisation and increased Murban processing at its Ruwais plant.

The world's largest group of oil producers, OPEC+, stuck to its guns on Saturday with another big increase of 411,000 barrels per day for July as it looks to wrestle back market share and punish over-producers.

The Big Star, a huge tanker with 2.1 million barrels of Russia's ESPO Blend oil onboard, has been waiting near China in a potential sign of weaker demand for the crude in the region, LSEG data showed and two traders said on Friday.

Russia has increased supplies of its oil from the Arctic to Syria, which needs the feedstock for its refineries, according to shipping data cited by an industry source and LSEG data.

The International Air Transport Association said on Sunday it expects the amount of sustainable aviation fuel produced to double in 2025 to reach 2 million tonnes, representing 0.7% of airlines' fuel consumption.

The net profit of Russia's largest oil producer Rosneft ROSN.MM was 170 billion roubles ($2.19 billion), the company said on Friday, less than half its level a year earlier due to high interest rates, sanctions and a stronger rouble.

111,Asia Naphtha/Gasoline-Naphtha window activity brisk; gasoline stays firm,"SINGAPORE, June 3 (Reuters) - Asian naphtha market activity stayed brisk on the trading window on Tuesday, though firm negotiations offscreen were slightly minimal as buyers have yet to start more July purchases.

Refining margins for the petrochemical feedstock NAF-SIN-CRK were little changed at around $87.5 per metric ton

Demand for second-half July arrival cargoes should surface either end of the week or next week, two trade sources said.

Traders were hoping for more arbitrage supplies to resurface in July, after volumes were limited for June with some estimates.

Some sellers have started to check with us for our outright demand requirements for second-half July, two Asian buyers said.

Gasoline markets remained supported by firm prompt demand, with refining margins GL92-SIN-CRK remaining at close to almost $11 per barrel.

Recent strength has slightly been driven by demand in the Middle East, given some scheduled refinery maintenance since last month, with one trader drawing cargoes from Asia to fulfill requirements there.

Markets also received further support from some production hiccups in southeast Asia and overall sufficient regional demand in the front months.

Meanwhile, exports from one of key Asian suppliers, China, were estimated at 600,000-650,000 metric tons for June loading now, slightly lower from last month due to squeezed margins outside home.



INVENTORIES

- U.S. crude oil stockpiles likely fell last week, while distillate and gasoline inventories likely rose, a preliminary Reuters poll found on Monday. EIA/S



NEWS

- Refiners across the globe are reaping unexpected profits from producing key fuels in recent weeks, offering an ailing sector respite before an anticipated weakening later this year, as plant closures have tightened fuel supply needed to meet peak summer demand.

- People took an estimated 657 million passenger trips during this year's Dragon Boat Festival holiday, up 3% year-on-year, China's state broadcaster reported, with the indicator closely watched as a barometer of Chinese consumer confidence.

83,"Oil output in Guyana fell to 611,000 bpd in April, government says","Adds context, data in paragraphs 3-5

GEORGETOWN, May 23 (Reuters) - Oil production in Guyana declined to an average 611,000 barrels per day in April from 627,000 bpd the previous month, according to a bulletin released by the government on Friday.

All oil and gas output in the South American nation is controlled by a consortium of U.S. companies Exxon Mobil XOM.N and Hess HES.N and China's CNOOC 600938.SS.

Production capacity is expected to surpass 900,000 bpd later this year once a fourth output facility that arrived in the country in February is installed and connected.

While average output in April fell, production at the consortium's Liza 2 and Payara projects increased at the end of the month beyond their typical range, the data showed, a signal the Exxon-led group is tapping into those projects' optimized potential after upgrades completed last year.

Average production between January and April averaged 626,000 bpd, versus 616,000 bpd in the same period last year.

Guyana received $296.2 million in revenue from the energy sector, which was deposited into its oil fund last month, according to central bank figures, increasing total revenue transferred to the fund so far this year to $901.6 million.

95,Colombia oil reserves grew 0.74% in 2024 but gas stocks decreased,"Adds data on reserves and oil production, and context

BOGOTA, May 27 (Reuters) - Colombia's oil reserves were up to the equivalent of 7.2 years of consumption at the close of 2024, the country's National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) regulator said on Tuesday.

The country's oil reserves increased by 0.74% in 2024 to 2.035 billion barrels of crude oil, after closing 2023 at 2.020 billion barrels of oil, equivalent to 7.1 years.

Reserves of gas - a key part of the country's energy transition - fell 13% to 2,064 giga cubic feet, the equivalent to 5.9 years of consumption, compared to 6.1 years of consumption at the end of 2023, the ANH said in a statement.

The figures are proven reserves, known in the industry as 1P.

Meanwhile, the average daily production of crude was 772,621 barrels per day in 2024, a decrease from the 777,151 barrels per day the year before.

Oil and gas are Colombia's top exports and generators of royalties, followed by coal.

The leftist government of President Gustavo Petro has been trying to move the country towards renewable energy with limited success amid project delays and legal headaches.

US consumer confidence improved in May
Updates prices as of 0621 GMT

May 28 (Reuters) - Gold steadied on Wednesday, as investors bought on the dip, although gains were capped on easing U.S.-EU trade tensions, with the market now awaiting the upcoming U.S. core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report for interest rate clues.

Spot gold XAU= was flat at $3,302.22 an ounce, as of 0621 GMT. Bullion fell more than 1% in the previous session.

U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were steady at $3,300.60.

In the latest move, U.S. President Donald Trump backed down from his 50% tariff threat against the European Union, delaying its implementation until July 9 to allow for negotiations between the White House and the 27-nation bloc.

""Gold's dip below $3300 saw it attracting some buyers. However, the broader market is still feeling generally upbeat now that the U.S.-EU trade tensions have eased, which is capping the extent of gold's upside run for now,"" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.

""If support in the $3,250-$3,280 region continues to hold, then gold is well-placed for potentially another run towards $3,400 if risk appetite fades.""

The market is now awaiting U.S. PCE data for April, due Friday, to assess the Federal Reserve's potential rate cut trajectory.

Meanwhile, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in May, ending a five-month slide, supported by a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, according to data.

The Fed has kept its policy rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.50% since December, as officials pause for more clarity on the economic and price impact of Trump's tariffs.

""More decisive moves in gold one way or the other may need to wait until we get a read on the Nvidia results and U.S. Core PCE on Friday,"" Waterer said.

June 5 (Reuters) - Gold prices were little changed on Thursday as investors assessed weaker-than-expected U.S. data and ongoing global economic and political uncertainties, while looking ahead to U.S. payroll data due a day later for further cues.

Spot gold XAU= edged down 0.3% to $3,365.73 an ounce, as of 0611 GMT. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were down 0.3% to $3,388.90.

At this stage, minor fluctuations in prices do not determine the overall direction, as gold continues to hold up relatively well, said ANZ Commodity Strategist Soni Kumari.

Federal Reserve reported a slowdown in U.S. economic activity, citing rising costs and prices driven by increased tariff rates since the last policy meeting.

The U.S. services sector contracted in May for the first time in nearly a year.

The ADP National Employment Report revealed U.S. private employers added the fewest workers in over two years in May, ahead of Friday's nonfarm payrolls data.

U.S. President Donald Trump described Chinese President Xi Jinping as ""extremely hard to make a deal with"" and reiterated his call to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates.

Trump's doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports took effect, with his administration seeking ""best offers"" from trade partners to avoid further levies slated for July.

""Gold finds itself in a holding pattern and at the whim of Trump's trade headlines ? supported, yet hesitant to trade above this week's high,"" said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at City Index.

Gold, a safe-haven asset during times of political and economic uncertainty, tends to thrive in a low-interest-rate environment.

May 28 (Reuters) - Gold firmed on Wednesday as investors bought the dip after prices declined in the previous session, while markets awaited minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting and economic data for insights on the U.S. interest rate outlook.

Spot gold XAU= was up 0.4% at $3,312.15 an ounce as of 1204 GMT. Prices fell below the $3,300 level and hit a low of $3,285.19 in the previous session.

U.S. gold futures GCcv1 rose 0.3% to $3,310.60.

""Gold is rebounding mainly due to bargain hunting after a sharp drop in the previous session,"" said Jigar Trivedi, senior commodity analyst at Reliance Securities.

""Markets are also in a wait-and-watch mode ahead of the Fed minutes, prompting position adjustments.""

Minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting were due later in the day, followed by the U.S. PCE data for April, due on Friday. A slew of Fed officials are also speaking this week, potentially offering further insights into monetary policy.

""Gold could climb on lower-than-expected PCE prints that ease stagflation fears while paving the way for more Fed rate cuts,"" said Han Tan, chief market analyst at Exinity Group.

The Fed at its May 6-7 meeting undercut expectations that it would change its policy interest rate anytime soon. Minutes from that session due later in the day may show just how firmly policymakers are holding onto their current wait-and-see approach.

The Fed has kept its policy rate at 4.25%-4.50% since December as officials wait for clearer insights into the economy.

Policymakers are also dealing with market volatility caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's fluctuating remarks on negotiations with the country's trading partners.

BNP Paribas expects U.S. gold futures GCcv1 to rise to $3,685 in the third quarter and to $3,850 in the fourth quarter on average.

LONDON/SEOUL/SINGAPORE, June 2 (Reuters) - U.S. prices of steel and aluminium spiked on Monday while shares of foreign steelmakers slumped after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would double tariffs on imports of the two metals to 50%.

Trump announced on Friday the new steel and aluminium levies, which take effect on June 4, intensifying a global trade war just hours after he accused China of violating an agreement with the U.S. to mutually roll back tariffs and trade restrictions for critical minerals.

The U.S. is the world's largest steel importer, excluding the European Union, with a total of 26.2 million tons of steel imported in 2024, according to the Department of Commerce.

While some industry experts questioned whether the tariffs would be implemented as stated, in light of Trump's previous reversals, they said uncertainty and climbing prices of the metals would dampen industrial activity.

""Higher prices are also likely to weigh further on U.S. steel demand from the manufacturing sector, which we already expect to contract this year,"" said analyst Eoin Dinsmore at Goldman Sachs.

The premium for consumers buying aluminium on the physical market in the United States < AUPc1> jumped 54%, while U.S. hot rolled coil steel HRCc1 climbed 7.4%.

Copper prices also surged as traders bet that Trump would impose hefty duties on the metal used in power and construction. U.S copper HGc2 touched a near two-month peak, widening its premium over benchmark London prices.

Germany's second-biggest steelmaker Salzgitter warned that Washington's tariff policy was dealing a severe blow to European industry.

The U.S. accounted for around a fifth of European steel exports outside of the EU, according to Germany's steel association.

""The risk for the European market, as well as other regional markets, is that some of the trade flow could reroute,"" said Bastian Synagowitz at Deutsche Bank.

Analysts were sceptical whether the full force of the tariffs as announced on Friday would come into play.

""I think the final result will be far lower than initially projected, especially concerning its duration,"" said Chelsea Ye, senior analyst at metals research firm McCloskey.

Meanwhile, the tariff shift was applauded by U.S. producers of aluminium, used in transport, packaging and construction, who said the move would stop a ""flood"" of imports.

ï¿½ï¿½For decades, subsidized foreign producers have hollowed out domestic aluminum manufacturing,"" said Mark Duffy, president of the American Primary Aluminum Association.

Shares of U.S. steelmakers climbed in early Wall Street trading, with Nucor NUE.N, Cleveland-Cliffs CLF.N and Steel Dynamics STLD.O surging between 11% and 24%.

ASIAN STEEL SHARES SLIDE

Shares of steelmakers fell in South Korea, which was the fourth-biggest exporter of steel to the U.S. last year, behind Canada, Mexico and Brazil, according to American Iron and Steel Institute data.

South Korea's Industry Ministry said in a statement that it had held an emergency meeting with officials from the country's major steelmakers, including POSCO 005490.KS and Hyundai Steel 004020.KS.

Shares of POSCO and Hyundai Steel fell 3%, while those of South Korean peer SeAH Steel Corp 306200.KS tumbled 8%.

In Vietnam, steel companies Hoa Sen Group HSG.HM, Nam Kim Steel NKG.HM and Vietnam Steel Corp TVN.HNO dropped between 2.7% and 3.4%.

The 50% tariffs will add to the challenges facing Korean steel exporters, which have refrained from sharply boosting exports to the U.S. to avoid Washington's scrutiny, despite rising U.S. steel prices, an industry executive told Reuters.

""It will be a burden to exporting companies if there are no additional steel price increases in the U.S,"" he told Reuters, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.

Steel and aluminium tariffs were among the earliest Trump imposed when he returned to office in January. Tariffs of 25% on most steel and aluminium imported to the U.S. went into effect on March 12.

TRADE TALKS

South Korea, a major U.S. ally, has called for an exemption from tariffs on steel, autos and others items, during talks with the United States.

Seoul agreed in late April to craft a trade package by the end of the 90-day pause on Trump's reciprocal tariffs in July, but it has been difficult for negotiators to make big decisions due to a political leadership vacuum ahead of elections on Tuesday.

In late March, Hyundai Steel announced a plan to build a $5.8 billion factory in Louisiana in response to U.S. tariffs, but the factory will not open until 2029. In April, Hyundai Steel's bigger rival POSCO signed a preliminary deal to make an equity investment in the factory project.

In India, which relies heavily on the U.S. for aluminium exports, industry experts also warned of a major hit.

""This is going to have a detrimental impact,"" B.K. Bhatia, director-general at the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, the country's leading mining body, told Reuters.

""The U.S. is the biggest market for Indian aluminium. Government has been negotiating so we are hopeful that with talks, the tariffs will come down.""

38,"News: CBOT Trends-Wheat up 2-3 cents, corn steady-up 1, soybeans down 3-4","CHICAGO, May 28 (Reuters) - The following are U.S. expectations for the resumption of grain and soy complex trading at the Chicago Board of Trade at 8:30 a.m. CDT (1330 GMT) on Wednesday.


WHEAT - Up 2 to 3 cents per bushel

CBOT wheat futures rose after U.S. crop ratings came in below market expectations, though prices remained within sight of a five-year low amid broadly favorable harvest prospects in the northern hemisphere and sluggish international demand.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly report showed only 45% of U.S. spring wheat in good to excellent condition, below the lowest in a range of analyst expectations.

For winter wheat, the agency rated 50% of the U.S. crop as good to excellent, down 2 points from a week earlier and beneath the average analyst forecast, though still the highest rating for this time of year since 2020.

CBOT July soft red winter wheat WN25 was last up 3-3/4 cents to $5.32-1/4 per bushel. K.C. July hard red winter wheat KWN25 was last up 5-1/4 cents to $5.29-3/4 per bushel. Minneapolis July spring wheat MWEN25 was last up 9-1/2 cents to $6.05-3/4 a bushel.


CORN - Steady to up 1 cent per bushel

Corn futures were nearly unchanged, though futures drew support from a lower than expected U.S. crop conditions score

Corn futures are under pressure from expectations of a large crop in Brazil, with agribusiness consultancy Datagro this week increasing its forecasts for the country's 2024/2025 crops.

The USDA rated 68% of the U.S. corn crop as good to excellent in its first condition ratings for the 2025 season, well below the average estimate of 73% in a Reuters analyst poll.

CBOT July corn CN25 was unchanged at $4.59-1/2 per bushel.


SOYBEANS - Down 3 to 4 cents per bushel

Soybeans ticked down on sluggish demand and a large Brazilian soybean harvest.

Soybean planting was 76% complete, behind the average estimate in the Reuters poll of 78%. The USDA's figure was up from 66% a week ago and well ahead of the five-year average of 68%. The government expects to release soybean condition ratings starting with next week's report.

CBOT July soybeans SN25 were down 4 cents to $10.58-1/2 per bushel.

May 23 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose 1% on Friday and were on track for their best week in six, boosted by a weaker dollar and as worries over the United States' worsening fiscal health sent investors towards safe-haven bullion.

Spot gold XAU=was up 1% at $3,325.47 an ounce as of 1119 GMT. Bullion has risen 4% this week, its highest since April 7.

U.S. gold futures GCcv1 gained 0.9% to $3,325.10.



President Donald Trump's tax bill is supporting gold as there are concerns that this is negative for the fiscal situation of the dollar and some investors are diversifying out of treasury into gold, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

""We have also seen the 30-year Treasury bills rising strongly in recent weeks, so this shows caution regarding the fiscal situation as well and in this environment, obviously an asset being perceived as a safe haven is benefiting.""

U.S. gold futures GCcv1 added 1.1% to $3,329.80.



The dollar .DXY has lost more than 1% this week and is set for its biggest weekly drop since April 7, making greenback-priced gold cheaper for holders of other currencies.

""This week, trade optimism has somewhat given way to worries about the U.S. fiscal situation, and the resulting hesitancy towards U.S. assets has put gold back in the frame with investors,"" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst, KCM Trade.

""Gold can likely maintain its foothold above the $3,000 level while tariff, U.S. debt and geopolitical (tension) remain swirling around financial markets.""

The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed a sweeping tax and spending bill that would enact much of President Donald Trump's policy agenda and saddle the country with trillions of dollars more in debt.

Intensifying Russia-Ukraine conflict raises grain supply fears
Favourable US Midwest crop weather to cap corn, soybean prices
Updates prices, adds detail

SINGAPORE/PARIS, June 5 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures rose on Thursday, supported by the escalating conflict between major grain suppliers Russia and Ukraine, a weak dollar, as well as dry weather threatening yields in top consumer China.

Corn prices firmed, but soybeans edged lower.

""Ukraine has hit Russia and there are fears of escalation which is supporting wheat prices,"" said one trader in Singapore.

A weak dollar against major currencies was also supporting prices although it was not enough to keep soybean prices in green territory. USD/

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 rose 0.5% to $5.46 a bushel, as of 1040 GMT. Corn Cv1 added 0.7% to $4.41-3/4 a bushel, while soybeans Sv1 gave up 0.2% to $10.42-1/2 a bushel.

Parts of China's wheat belt in Shaanxi and Henan provinces have been hit hard by hot and dry weather, with near-record temperatures threatening to reduce yields.

Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Russian targets, prompting Russian President Vladimir Putin to tell the U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation that Moscow would have to respond, escalating worries over grain supplies.

Ukrainian corn exports are set to fall to 1 million metric tons in June from 2 million tons in May, as Ukraine-origin corn is uncompetitive compared to its American equivalent, producers' union UAC said on Wednesday.

Corn and soybean prices are being capped by favourable weather in the U.S. Midwest, where farmers are wrapping up their planting.

Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT corn, wheat, soybean and soymeal futures contracts on Wednesday and small net sellers of soyoil futures. COMFUND/CBT",,2025-06-05 20:21:00.000 +0900,2025-06-05 20:21:00.000 +0900,Wheat futures,TRUE,Reuters,TRUE
74,US copper futures surge as tariff fears loom,"Updates prices

June 2 (Reuters) - U.S. copper futures jumped on Monday, widening their premium over London prices, amid speculation about possible new import tariffs after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would double tariffs on aluminium and steel imports to 50%.

The most active U.S. Comex copper futures HGc2 hit $4.9495, the highest since April 3, and were last up 4.0% at $4.8625 a pound. Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) CMCU3 rose 1.2% to $9,607 per metric ton by 1600 GMT.

""Although copper wasn't even mentioned in Trump's latest announcement, markets are clearly pricing in the risk of import tariffs following the February investigation,"" said Panmure Liberum analyst Tom Price, referring to Washington's ongoing probe into possible new tariffs on copper imports.

The premium on COMEX copper over the LME price, a global benchmark, widened to $1,113 per ton from $772 on Friday. 0#LMECMXCU:

""For now, the COMEX premium is likely to continue pulling material to the U.S., drawing down ex-U.S. inventories and keeping ex-U.S. markets tight,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note. It estimates that around 200,000 tons of additional material were imported to the U.S. in the last eight weeks.

Copper stocks in the LME-registered warehouses MCUSTX-TOTAL are down 45% since mid-February at 148,450 tons, lowest in almost a year.

Indicating worries about nearby supply in the LME system, the spread between the cash LME and the three-month copper contract CMCU0-3 hit a premium of $51.57 a ton, highest since November 2022, last week. The premium was last at $46 on Monday.

Making dollar-priced metals more attractive for buyers using other currencies, the U.S. currency extended losses on Monday after data showed U.S. manufacturing contracted for a third straight month in May.

In top metals consumer China, where markets will open on Tuesday after the Dragon Boat holiday, data showed the country's manufacturing activity contracted in May for a second month.

LME aluminium CMAL3 rose 1.2% to $2,473 a ton, while the aluminium premium for U.S. buyers soared, reacting to Trump's plan to double the import tariff.

LME lead CMPB3climbed 1.2% to $1,980.50, zinc CMZN3 gained 3.1% to $2,700, tin CMSN3 added 0.8% at $30,550 and nickel CMNI3 rose 1.8% to $15,500.

Trump backed away from his threat to impose 50% tariffs on imports from the European Union next month, restoring a July 9 deadline to allow for talks between Washington and the 27-nation bloc to produce a deal.

78,Copper steadies amid tariff uncertainty,"Updates prices

LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - Copper prices steadied on Tuesday as uncertainty about U.S. tariffs policy kept the premium of U.S. copper futures against the London benchmark high, offsetting weaker-than-expected factory activity in top metals consumer China.

Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 rose 0.1% to $9,622.50 per metric ton by 1631 GMT.

The most active U.S. Comex copper futures HGc2 fell 0.5% to $4.8355 a pound, meaning the premium against the LME benchmark was $1,037 a ton.

Comex futures hit $4.9495 on Monday, the highest since April 3, on concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to double tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to 50% starting on Wednesday would mean that new U.S. copper tariffs, subject to an ongoing investigation in Washington, were more likely.

Limiting copper's growth on Tuesday was data showing that China's factory activity shrank for the first time in eight months and a stronger dollar. FRX/

The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI fell to the lowest reading in 32 months, a private-sector survey showed. On Saturday, China's official PMI showed May factory activity fell for a second month.

With U.S. manufacturing also contracting in May, traders were waiting for a possible call between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. According to the White House, they were likely to speak this week.

Providing support to LME copper were continuing outflows from stocks in LME-registered warehouses. LME's daily data showed inventory fell to 143,850 tons, the lowest in almost a year, after 4,600 were delivered out.

The spread between the cash price and the three-month copper contract CMCU0-3 was last at a premium of $51 a ton, indicating concerns about nearby supply in the LME system.

The concerns are partly related to Ivanhoe Mines' IVN.TOKakula mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which was hit by seismic activities that caused flooding underground.

With Ivanhoe's plan to restart a section of the mine in June, the net loss of production from the mine is expected to be 84,000 tons over four months, Alice Fox, commodities strategist at Macquarie, said in a note.

Among other LME metals, aluminium CMAL3 was steady at $2,467 a ton, zinc CMZN3 added 0.2% to $2,702.50, lead CMPB3 gained 0.1% to $1,982, tin CMSN3 climbed 2.2% to $31,330, while nickel CMNI3 lost 0.5% to $15,460.

79,London copper prices ease; US tariff concerns persist,"SINGAPORE, June 4 (Reuters) - Prices of London copper ticked down on Wednesday as uncertainty over U.S. tariffs on the metal kept a lid on prices.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 eased 0.2% to $9,615.5 per metric ton by 0102 GMT. The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange SCFcv1 gained 0.5% to 78,910 yuan ($10,979.24) a ton.

Starting Wednesday, the U.S. has doubled tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to 50% for all trading partners except Britain, the only country whose steel and aluminium exports will be taxed at 25% until at least July 9.

""Copper found some support amid fears that the metal may also be subject to U.S. tariffs. The Trump administration is currently reviewing the impact of U.S. copper imports on the local industry,"" ANZ said.

The dollar drifted lower as the market looked ahead to U.S. employment data for May for immediate trading cues, while waiting on developments in President Donald Trump's tariff negotiations with key trading partners, including China. USD/

80,Copper inches down with focus on trade developments,"Updates prices at 1600 GMT

June 4 (Reuters) - Copper prices eased on Wednesday as tariff worries countered stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data, while focus stayed on U.S. President Donald Trump's trade negotiations.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 was down 0.1% at $9,624.50 per metric ton by 1400 GMT.

Trump signed an executive proclamation that puts into effect from Wednesday his surprise announcement last week that he was taking the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that had been in place since March to 50% from 25%.

Wednesday is also when the White House would like trading partners to submit their proposals for deals that might help them avoid Trump's hefty ""Liberation Day"" tariffs from taking effect in five weeks.

Meanwhile, job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose 191,000 to 7.391 million by the last day of April, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Tuesday.

""Yesterday's JOLTS, which was better than expected, leaves markets surprised by the resilience of the U.S. economy,"" said Alastair Munro at broker Marex.

LME copper also benefited from continued outflows from LME-registered warehouses. LME's daily data showed inventory fell to 141,350 tons, a near one-year low, after 2,500 were delivered out.

The latest metal tariffs have renewed focus on the ongoing U.S. investigation into potential new copper import duties, aimed at boosting domestic production.

This has pushed COMEX copper prices above LME levels, prompting traders to reroute copper supplies to the U.S. to take advantage of the price gap. HG-STX-COMEX

U.S. Comex copper futures HGc2 rose 0.9% to $4.88 a lb, bringing the premium over LME copper to $1,201 a ton.

Tin CMSN3 was the strongest performer on the LME, hitting a one-week high on concerns about supply. It gained 1.9% to $31,960 a ton.

LME aluminium CMAL3 firmed 0.9% to $2,486 a ton and lead CMPB3 rose 0.3% to $1,991, while zinc CMZN3 slipped 0.3% to $2,698 and nickel CMNI3 shed 0.3% to $15,400.

81,Copper inches higher on weaker dollar; tariff developments in focus,"June 5 (Reuters) - London copper prices inched up on Thursday amid a weakening U.S. dollar, while the market focus remained on a series of trade talks between the U.S. and its major trading partners.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 gained 0.31% to $9,651 per metric ton, as of 0102 GMT, and the most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange SCFcv1 stayed largely steady at 78,190 yuan ($10,890.43).

The dollar index =USDremained near six-week lows on weak U.S. economic data, making dollar-denominated assets less expensive for holders of other currencies. FRX/

On the trade front, U.S. President Donald Trump calledhis Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping tough and ""extremely hard to make a deal with"" on Wednesday, exposing frictions after the White House raised expectations of a long-awaited phone call between the two leaders this week.

Canada prepared possible reprisals, while the European Union reported progress in trade talks on Wednesday, as new U.S. metals tariffs triggered more disruption in the global economy and added urgency to negotiations with Washington.

""Trump's 50% tariffs on aluminium and steel have raised expectations that he will soon follow through with a pledge to impose stiffer duties on copper as well,"" ANZ said.

Tin CMSN3 on the LME eased around 0.3% to $31,935 a ton after hitting a one-week high on Wednesday on concerns that the resumption of supply from Myanmar's tin-rich Wa State would take longer than previously expected.

135,News: CBOT wheat ends lower as US crop ratings improve,"CHICAGO, June 3 (Reuters) - Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures ended lower on Tuesday, pressured by improving U.S. wheat condition ratings and a firmer dollar, which tends to make U.S. grains less competitive globally, traders said.

CBOT July soft red winter wheat WN25 settled down 3 cents at $5.36 per bushel.

K.C. July hard red winter wheat KWN25 ended down 3 cents at $5.36-3/4 while Minneapolis July spring wheat MWEN25 fell 9-1/4 cents to finish at $6.18 a bushel.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday rated 50% of the U.S. spring wheat crop as good-to-excellent, up 5 percentage points from the prior week, while winter wheat ratings improved to 52% good-to-excellent, up 2 points. The ratings for both crops were better than most analysts had expected.

Seasonal pressure from the start of the Northern Hemisphere winter wheat harvest also hung over prices. The USDA said the U.S. winter wheat harvest was 3% complete as of June 1.

European wheat futures drifted lower, hovering near contract lows, as traders assessed further Ukrainian strikes on Russian targets, as well as improved U.S. crop ratings.

Corn and soybeans steady after lows

Favourable crop conditions and tariff tensions weigh on grain markets

Updates with European trading, changes byline/dateline

By Gus Trompiz and Naveen Thukral

PARIS/SINGAPORE, June 3 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat edged lower on Tuesday, giving up some of the previous session's gains as better-than-expected U.S. crop ratings put the focus back on favourable harvest prospects.

Corn and soybeans ticked up after hitting six-month and seven-week lows, respectively, that were also linked to good crop conditions.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 fell 0.4% to $5.36-3/4 a bushel by 1144 GMT.

The contract had risen sharply during Monday's session as a Ukrainian drone attack in Russia shifted attention back on the war between the two grain exporters, though prices pared their gains by the close.

""As often happens, the rally failed to hold,"" CM Navigator analyst Donatas Jankauskas said in a note. ""The U.S. crop progress report is helping cool the wheat market further this morning.""

In its weekly crop progress report released after Monday's close, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 50% of U.S. spring wheat and 52% of winter wheat were in good to excellent condition, up from the prior week and exceeding average analyst expectations.

The U.S. winter wheat crop has been plagued by persistent dryness, but recent rains have helped the crop rebound.

However, comments by Ukraine's agriculture minister suggesting the country's cereal harvest may fall by as much as 10% this year also underlined mixed harvest prospects in parts of the Northern Hemisphere.

Traders were nonetheless monitoring war headlines as Ukraine appeared to be continuing strikes against Russian targets.

A bounce in the dollar index =USD, which makes U.S. grain dearer overseas, also curbed wheat prices.

CBOT corn Cv1 inched up 0.1% to $4.38-3/4 a bushel, after reaching its lowest since early December at $4.34-1/4 earlier in the session. Soybeans Sv1 added 0.4% to $10.37-1/4 a bushel as it held above Monday's seven-week low of $10.32-1/2.

The USDA rated 67% of U.S. soybeans in good to excellent condition in its initial ratings of the 2025 soy crop, just below an average of analyst estimate for 68% but roughly on par with previous years. For corn, the agency's rating improved to 69% good-to-excellent, up a percentage point from last week and in line with trade expectations.

The soybean market has also been pressured by renewed trade tensions between the United States and China, the world's biggest soybean buyer, after President Donald Trump on Friday accused Beijing of violating an agreement with the U.S. to mutually roll back tariffs.

Corn drops to lowest in six month of U.S. crop prospects

AgRural raises forecasts for Brazil's 24/25 corn, soybean crops

Adds quote in paragraph 3, updates prices

By Naveen Thukral

SINGAPORE, June 3 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat slid on Tuesday, giving up some of previous session's gains, as improved U.S. crop condition weighed on prices, although intensifying Russia-Ukraine war limited losses.

Corn fell to its lowest level in six months, while soybeans inched higher.

""Any news of improved production prospects are going to be bearish for wheat prices as we get closer to the harvest in northern hemisphere,"" said a Singapore-based grains trader.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 fell 0.7% to $5.35-1/4 a bushel, as of 0415 GMT.

Corn Cv1 lost 0.6% to $4.35-1/2 a bushel, trading close to its lowest level since early December hit earlier in the session. Soybeans Sv1 rose 0.2% to $10.35-1/4 a bushel.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) weekly crop progress report showed on Monday 50% of U.S. spring wheat and 52% of winter wheat in good to excellent condition, exceeding analyst expectations.

The U.S. winter wheat crop has been plagued by persistent dryness, but recent rains have helped the crop rebound. The USDA ratings surpassed analyst predictions of a 50% good to excellent rating for the winter wheat crop and a 47% rating for spring wheat.

Wheat prices rose on Monday on short covering as a Ukrainian drone attack in Russia shifted attention back on the war between the two grain exporters.

Australia's wheat production is projected to drop 10% this year to 30.6 million metric tons due to dry conditions across several cropping regions. Nevertheless, production is expected to remain well above the 10-year average, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences said in a quarterly crop report.

The pressure on the soybean market stemmed from trade tensions with China, the world's biggest soybean buyer, after President Donald Trump on Friday accused China of violating an agreement with the U.S. to mutually roll back tariffs.

Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will likely speak this week, the White House said on Monday.

Ample Brazilian soy supplies continue to pressure the market. Agribusiness consultancy AgRural raised its forecast for Brazil's 2024/25 soybean crop by 1.3 million tons to 169 million tons, citing improved yields.

The USDA rated 67% of U.S. soybeans in good to excellent condition in its initial ratings of the 2025 soy crop, just below an average of analyst estimates for 68% but roughly on par with previous years. Soybean planting was 84% complete, ahead of the five-year average of 80%.

The agency's corn rating improved to 69% good-to-excellent, up a percentage point from last week and in line with trade expectations. Planting was 93% complete, matching the five-year average.

Commodity funds hold a large net short position in CBOT wheat futures, leaving the market prone to short-covering rallies.

CBOT July soft red winter wheat WN25 settled up 5 cents at $5.39 per bushel.

Russia and Ukraine began their second round of direct peace talks since 2022 in Istanbul on Monday with no sign they are closer to an agreement, one day after Kyiv struck some of Moscow's nuclear-capable bombers far inside Russian territory.

Ahead of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly crop progress report due later on Monday, analysts surveyed by Reuters on average expected the government to raise its ratings for the U.S. spring wheat crop after last week's ratings fell well below trade expectations.

U.S. winter wheat ratings were seen as steady as the harvest of that crop begins.

New military agency took over purchases in December

Sources say cargoes are facing delays

Egypt is one of world's biggest wheat buyers

By Sarah El Safty, Mohamed Ezz and Gus Trompiz

DUBAI, June 2 (Reuters) - Egypt's state grains buyer Mostakbal Misr agreed in April to buy around 180,000 metric tons of French wheat from two top European traders, trading sources said, in a sign of growing acceptance of the new entity by global suppliers.

Mostakbal Misr bought two 60,000 metric ton cargoes from one firm and another similarly sized cargo from another, two trading sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, though they said delivery of the cargoes was facing delays.

The private agreement, which has not been previously reported, is one of the few instances Mostakbal Misr has been able to secure cargoes for Egypt's massive bread subsidy programme directly from global suppliers. Those suppliers have been hesitant to deal with the little-known military agency, traders say.

Egypt is one of the world's top wheat importers, buying about five million tons from abroad on average. For decades, the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), a civilian agency that is part of the supply ministry, imported wheat and vegetable oils through international tenders.

Since Mostakbal Misr took over the import of major commodities in December, it has relied on local importers to act as intermediaries on purchases.

Its lack of experience dealing with global commodity traders contributed to early teething problems, said one of the sources.

""Global traders were asking for a commercial registry or a tax card so that risk departments would approve any deals with them but that was not provided,"" the source said. ""That's why local importers came in as intermediaries.""

If the deals can be successfully concluded it would mark a breakthrough for Mostakbal Misr, but the sources, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said there had been delays in opening letters of credit to pay for the shipments, as well as in assigning freight to transport them.

Traders said at least some of the volume was expected to be loaded in May, and the rest in June.

The second source said the two cargoes were sold at a price of $246 per ton for immediate, ""at sight"" payment, while the third cargo was sold for $256 per ton with deferred payment via 180-day letters of credit.

Egypt's supply ministry and Mostakbal Misr did not respond to requests for comment.

Suppliers went ahead with the deal as a result of weak global demand, especially for French wheat which has been impacted by a spat with Algeria, the first source said.

The deal coincided with a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to Egypt in April. Reuters could not determine if the deal was connected to the visit.

The sales to Egypt could be a boost for French wheat exports after a dire spell marked by a poor harvest and diplomatic tensions with Algeria, though the absence of any loadings in May has created uncertainty in the market over the deals.

France exports wheat only occasionally to Egypt, with its previous shipments dating back to July last year.

The European Union's biggest wheat producer generally struggles to compete against Black Sea suppliers like Russia and Romania that dominate the Egyptian import market.

But traders say a drop in French prices this year coupled with increased Black Sea prices created an opportunity.

Bulgarian wheat that Mostakbal Misr bought directly in a similar deal earlier this year was successfully shipped.

""This time is more serious than others. They are dealing with big international suppliers directly,"" said the second source. ""We are waiting to see how this deal is going to be executed.""

By Gus Trompiz and Naveen Thukral

PARIS/SINGAPORE, May 30 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat and corn edged higher on Friday as the cereal markets consolidated after losses this week linked to favourable U.S. and global harvest prospects.

Soybeans ticked lower to hold near Thursday's three-week low, curbed by expectations of ample supplies along with uncertainty over biofuel demand as the U.S. government considers waivers for oil refiners.

A firmer dollar =USD kept grain prices in check as grain markets awaited an update on demand from weekly U.S. export sales figures later on Friday.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 rose 0.7% to $5.37-3/4 a bushel by 1015 GMT. Corn Cv1 added 0.5% to $4.49-1/4 a bushel to steady after a one-week low on Thursday.

CBOT soybeans Sv1 inched down 0.1% at $10.50-1/2 a bushel to consolidate above Thursday's low of $10.40.

Agricultural consultancy Sovecon on Thursday raised its forecast for Russia's wheat exports for the 2025-2026 season by 1.1 million metric tons to 40.8 million tons, citing improved weather conditions for the harvest.

India is likely to produce a record 117.5 million metric tons of wheat in the year ending June 2025, the farm ministry said, above its March forecast of 115.4 million tons.

In the U.S., winter wheat conditions are at a five-year high despite an unexpected decline last week, while regular showers have helped most corn and soybean crops get off to a good start to their growing season.

With expectations rising for Brazil's upcoming second corn crop, the corn market found little support in large export sales reported on Thursday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

""Despite exceptional export sales reported by the USDA ?”amounting to 205,096 tons for the 2024/25 campaign ??market support remains absent,"" Argus Media analysts said in a note.

The soybean market was assessing a Reuters report that the White House is considering a plan to clear a record backlog of requests from small refineries for exemptions from U.S. biofuel laws.

SINGAPORE, May 30 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat edged higher on Friday, with bargain-buying supporting prices, although the market is poised for its first weekly decline in three weeks on expectations of higher exports from Russia and improved yields in India.

Soybeans eased, while corn prices nudged higher, but both markets were set for weekly losses on improved U.S. weather.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1rose 0.3% to $5.35-3/4 a bushel, as of 0259 GMT, corn Cv1 added 0.1% to $4.47-1/2 a bushel and soybeans Sv1 lost 0.6% to $10.45 a bushel.

For the week, wheat is down 1.2%, corn has given up 2.6% and soybeans have lost 1.4%.

Agricultural consultancy Sovecon on Thursday raised its forecast for Russia's wheat exports for the 2025-2026 season by 1.1 million metric tons to 40.8 million tons, citing improved weather conditions for the harvest.

India is likely to produce a record 117.5 million metric tons of wheat in the year ending June 2025, the farm ministry said, above its March forecast of 115.4 million tons, as higher prices prompted farmers to expand the area planted with high-yielding seed varieties.

Wheat planting for the 2025-26 season started at a good pace in Argentina, supported by dry weather in the west and north of the country, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange (BdeC) said on Thursday.

Drier weather is expected across the central U.S. through the weekend, but widespread rain is forecast for the six to 10-day period, according to Commodity Weather Group, benefiting corn and soybeans.

Rains in the U.S. central and southern Plains aided soil moisture this week, according to weather forecaster Vaisala. Meanwhile, relatively dry weather across the Midwest and northern Plains favored spring wheat planting.

The dollar was mixed on Friday as investors factored in the likelihood of trade tariffs remaining in some form, even as U.S. President Donald Trump faces a court battle over his authority to impose them.

142,"News: Australia forecasts wheat output down 10% on dry conditions; barley, canola also hit","CANBERRA, June 3 (Reuters) - Australia's wheat production is projected to drop 10% this year to 30.6 million metric tons, with barley and canola output also expected to fall due to dry conditions across several cropping regions, the agriculture ministry said.

Nevertheless, production is expected to remain well above the 10-year average, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) said in a quarterly crop report.

Australia is one of the world's biggest agricultural exporters.

Low soil moisture in southern New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and the northern wheat belt of Western Australia led some farmers to reduce planted area, and dry-sown crops now depend on June rainfall to germinate and establish, ABARES said.

Conditions are significantly better in Queensland, northern New South Wales and southern parts of Western Australia, and forecasts point to above-average winter rainfall across most cropping regions.

""However ... it will be crucial for forecast rainfall to be realised to meet current yield projections,"" ABARES said.

Barley production is set to fall 3% to 12.8 million tons this year and canola output to shrink 6% to 5.7 million tons, according to ABARES.

Australia produced an average of 27.6 million tons of wheat, 11.8 million tons of barley, and 4.8 million tons of canola annually in the 10 years to 2024/25, government data show.

Australian farmers are expected to plant 12.6 million hectares of wheat this year, down 3% from last year, 4.7 million hectares of barley, up 2% from year-ago levels, and 3.4 million hectares of canola, down 1% year-on-year, ABARES forecast.

Median forecasts from a Reuters poll of analysts last month projected that the wheat planted area would remain unchanged, barley would expand by 2%, and canola would decline by 5%.

Analysts' forecasts for Australian wheat production ranged from 28 million tons to 34 million tons.

In other crops, ABARES said Australian lentil production should rise 17% to 1.5 million tons this year, while chickpea output is likely to drop 17% to 1.9 million tons.

Concerns over Black Sea grain trade simmered as Ukraine stepped up attacks on Russian targets. Russian President Vladimir Putin told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation that Moscow would have to respond to high-profile Ukrainian drone attacks, according to Trump.

Parts of China's wheat belt in Shaanxi and Henan provinces have been hit by hot, dry weather that could reduce harvests, though it was unclear if this would prompt more imports given large Chinese stocks.

Ahead of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly export sales report on Thursday, analysts expected sales of U.S. new-crop wheat in the week ended May 29 at 300,000 to 800,000 metric tons.

Meanwhile, recent rains in the U.S. winter wheat belt have improved crop ratings but also raised worries about crop quality in states including Oklahoma as the harvest begins. Quality problems could pressure prices by creating supplies of undesirable grain.

WHEAT - Up 3 to 4 cents per bushel

CBOT wheat Wv1 rose on Wednesday, underpinned by signs of a hardening conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

The wheat market has been torn this week between concern over Black Sea grain trade, as Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Russian targets, and improved conditions for U.S. crops as estimated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly crop progress report on Monday.

Traders were also monitoring drought damage to the wheat crop in China, though it was unclear if this would prompt more imports given large Chinese stocks.

CORN - Up 4 to 5 cents per bushel

CBOT corn Cv1 ticked up on technical trading and an uptick in global export demand for U.S. corn.

A weakened U.S. dollar and hopes that tariff negotiations between Washington and grain importers like China and Vietnam will boost U.S. exports have also added support to prices.

September milling wheat BL2U5, the most active position on Paris-based Euronext, settled 0.2% down at 202.00 euros a metric ton to hold near last Thursday's contract low of 200.25 euros.

In a choppy session, Euronext and Chicago wheat Wv1 both saw early weakness after the overnight publication of better-than-expected scores for U.S. wheat conditions. Prices later turned higher as news that Ukraine had hit the road and rail bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula revived fears of escalation in the war between the two grain-exporting countries that had spurred a rally on Monday. GRA/

Euronext still lacked impetus with slow export demand and expectations of ample global supply in the upcoming season weighing on sentiment.

""It's hard to see many bullish factors,"" a futures dealer said. ""There's a big discount on new-crop prices in the Black Sea, so there's no reason for buyers to come in now. I think the old-crop export demand is pretty much over.""

Hopes of a run of French exports at the end of the current season that closes on June 30 have been cooled by delays to the expected shipment of around 180,000 tons of French wheat to Egypt, according to sources.

148,News: Argentina wheat planting begins at a good pace,"BUENOS AIRES, May 29 (Reuters) - Wheat planting for the 2025/26 season started at a good pace in Argentina, supported by dry weather in the west and north of the country, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange (BdeC) said on Thursday.

Argentina is a major world exporter of wheat and in recent weeks its farmers started sowing the cereal, with the BdeC projecting a planted area of 6.7 million hectares.

""Planting activity was mainly concentrated in the north and center-west of the agricultural region, with notable progress in the Center-North of Cordoba province, which is ahead of the average pace of the last five campaigns,"" the exchange said, adding that 10.5% of the projected area had been planted.

However, wheat planting in the eastern core agricultural area faces delays due to recent heavy rains, the exchange added in its weekly crop report.

According to the exchange's weekly crop report, harvesting of soybeans and corn in key eastern regions is running behind schedule, with the soybean harvest 80.7% complete and the corn harvest at 40.5%.

On Wednesday, the BdeC and the Rosario Grains Exchange said that dry and cold weather conditions in the coming days should help improve field access and allow harvest work to advance.

Argentina is the world's top exporter of soybean oil and meal, and the third-largest exporter of corn. The BdeC forecasts 2024/25 soybean production at 50 million tonnes and corn production at 49 million tonnes.

By Renee Hickman

CHICAGO, May 28 (Reuters) - Chicago soybean futures dropped on Wednesday as the U.S. Department of Agriculture's data showed rapid planting progress, and demand was slow, according to analysts.

Meanwhile wheat firmed slightly after U.S. crop ratings came in below market expectations, though they were pressured by broadly favorable harvest prospects in the northern hemisphere and sluggish international demand, analysts said.

Corn futures fell, with planting progress for the crop also moving quickly and showers having recently limited stress on the Midwestern corn crop, according to forecaster Commodity Weather Group.

On the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) most active soybeans Sv1 lost 11-1/2 cents to $10.51 a bushel by 12:28 p.m. CST (1728 GMT).

CBOT wheat Wv1 gained 1-1/2 cents at $5.30 a bushel and corn Cv1 fell 8 cents to $4.51-1/2 per bushel.

The USDA's weekly crop progress report, released after the close of trading on Tuesday, showed 76% of U.S. soybeans planted as of Sunday vs 66% a week ago, and ahead of the five-year average of 68%. Those numbers fell behind trade expectations of 78% in a Reuters poll of analysts, however.

Meanwhile, the USDA said U.S. farmers had planted 87% of their intended corn acres by Sunday, up from 78% a week earlier and ahead of the five-year average of 85%.

""Demand has slowed considerably for both corn and soybeans, which is normal for this time of year as South American supplies dominate; leaving the early season planting progress and growing conditions as the primary driver of market direction,"" said Brian Hoops, president of Midwest Market Solutions.

And in wheat, the USDA showed only 45% of U.S. spring wheat in good to excellent condition, below the lowest in a range of analyst expectations, which gave support to futures.

Corn and soybeans are also under pressure from expectations of a large crop in Brazil, with agribusiness consultancy Datagro this week increasing its forecasts for the country's 2024/2025 crops.

WHEAT - Down 8 to 9 cents per bushel

CBOT wheat futures fell for a third straight session on Tuesday, as the risk of crop-damaging weather ahead of the northern hemisphere harvest receded, reinforcing expectations of a well-supplied market.

Recent days have seen rain in dry parts of northern Europe, rainfall forecasts in drought-hit cropping regions in China, an upward revision to a wheat yield forecast in the European Union and an upgraded production estimate for Russia.

Traders were awaiting the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly crop report later on Tuesday to see if U.S. winter wheat conditions continued to improve last week.

Export demand for wheat remains tepid and export prices in top shipper Russia dipped last week.

CBOT July soft red winter wheat WN25 was last down 9-1/2 cents to $5.33 per bushel. K.C. July hard red winter wheat KWN25 was last down 11-1/4 cents to $5.27-1/2 a bushel. Minneapolis July spring wheat MWEN25 was last down 6 cents to $6.00-1/2 a bushel.


CORN - Down 1 to 2 cents per bushel

Corn futures lowered, curbed by a bounce in the dollar.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture in its weekly crop report Tuesday afternoon will release corn condition ratings and planting progress.

A lack of weather risks to the U.S. corn crop have weighed on prices.

CBOT July corn CN25 was last down 3/4 cent to $4.58-3/4 per bushel.


SOYBEANS - Up 5 to 6 cents per bushel

Soybeans rose under support from soyoil futures, which have rallied on hopes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will release new biofuel blending mandates.

CBOT July soybeans SN25 were last up 6-1/4 cents to $10.66-1/2 per bushel.

June 3 (Reuters) - Gold fell nearly 1% on Tuesday after hitting a near four-week high, pressured by a firmer dollar as investors grew cautious ahead of a potential call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Spot gold XAU= fell 0.9% to $3,352.30 an ounce as of 2:26 p.m. ET (1826 GMT), after hitting its highest since May 8, earlier in the session.

U.S. gold futures GCcv1 settled 0.6% lower at $3,377.10.



The dollar .DXY rose 0.5% from an over-a-month low hit earlier in the session, making gold costlier for foreign buyers. USD/

""We are moving into this period that is well known to be the summer doldrums, so there's an expectation that the gold market could fall into a bit of a lull or a sideways consolidation,"" said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.

Markets are on edge ahead of a likely Trump-Xi call this week, after Trump accused China of violating an agreement to roll back tariffs. The talks come as trade tensions between the world's two largest economies continue to simmer.

Separately, the European Commission said it would push for lower U.S. tariffs even as Trump proposed doubling duties on steel and aluminum, while Washington urged trade partners to submit revised offers by Wednesday to speed up talks.

Investors are also eyeing Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls data and a slate of Federal Reserve speakers for clues on rate policy.

U.S. data on Tuesday showed job openings rose in April, but higher layoffs signaled a cooling labor market amid growing tariff concerns.

""I believe the Fed is ready to begin to cut rates again, but more than likely not until September ... that is another factor likely to weigh on the dollar and support gold,"" Meger added.

Gold, a safe-haven during times of political and economic uncertainty, tends to thrive in a low-interest-rate environment. It is up about 28% this year.

Spot silver XAG= fell 0.8% to $34.51 an ounce, but lingered near a seven-month peak hit in the previous session.

Continued copper strength, driven by firm Chinese demand, tight global supplies and green energy trends, could support silver's rally, Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note.

85,Oil prices fall for three weeks in the face of tariff threats and higher OPEC+ production,"Oil prices posted gains at the close of trading on Friday; however, they posted a third consecutive weekly loss due to concerns about Donald Trump's tariffs and a possible increase in crude oil supply.

The U.S. WTI July contract rose 0.62% from the previous day's close, to 61.58 dollars; while North Sea Brent for July delivery gained 0.65%, to 64.86 dollars per barrel, according to Bloomberg data.

Oil prices

However, the day's gains could not prevent a decline for the whole week. U.S. WTI had a drop of 0.64%; while in the case of North Sea Brent the retreat was 0.73%.

Oil is impacted by different fronts

Crude oil prices have been strongly impacted by the expectation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) will increase supply in the coming months.

Members of the organization are meeting next week and the market is expecting a production increase of 411,000 barrels per day (bpd) to be announced for July.

During this month, Reuters reported that OPEC+ could withdraw the remainder of its voluntary production cut of 2.2 million bpd by the end of October. The above after having increased production targets by close to 1 million bpd for April, May and June.

Adding to this pressure was US President Donald Trump's recommendation to apply 50% tariffs on European Union goods as of June 1, arguing that the bloc is difficult to deal with on trade issues.

June 3 (Reuters) - Gold pulled back on Tuesday after nearing a four-week high earlier in the session, as a rebound in the dollar and profit-taking added pressure, while investors remained cautious amid ever-changing U.S. trade policies.

Spot gold XAU= fell 0.7% to $3,356.75 an ounce as of 1125 GMT, after hitting its highest since May 8 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 eased 0.5% to $3,381.30.

""Today, the dollar trades a tad stronger ahead of key US economic data and these developments are the main reason why we are seeing some light profit following yesterdayï¿½ï¿½s strong gain,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.

Investors will be closely watching a likely call this week between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, just days after Trump accused China of breaching an agreement to reduce tariffs and trade restrictions.

The European Commission said on Monday it would push the U.S. to reduce or eliminate tariffs, despite Trump's plan to double steel and aluminium duties to 50%.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is urging countries to submit their best trade offers by Wednesday, aiming to accelerate talks ahead of a five-week deadline, according to a draft letter seen by Reuters.

The OECD said on Tuesday the global economy was on course to slow from 3.3% last year to 2.9% in 2025 and 2026, trimming March estimates for growth of 3.1% this year and 3.0% next year.

Investors' focus this week will also be on U.S. non-farm payrolls due on Friday and speeches from a slew of Federal Reserve policymakers for clues on the interest rate trajectory.

Tensions between Washington and Beijing returned to the fore after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday accused China of violating an agreement with the U.S. to mutually roll back tariffs and trade restrictions for critical minerals.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday signalled a possible call soon between Trump and China's President Xi Jinping to iron out trade issues.

Gold tends to benefit in low-rate environments and during bouts of geopolitical stress.

May 29 (Reuters) - Gold prices dropped to a more than one-week low on Thursday after a U.S. trade court blocked most of President Donald Trump's tariffs, signalling easing trade risks and denting demand for the safe-haven metal.

A stronger dollar makes greenback-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.

""The court's decision triggered a relief in the financial markets and with that came more risk appetites, which weighs on gold,"" Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at brokerage firm ActivTrades, said.

The White House swiftly appealed the decision and signaled it may take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary.

Trump levied ""reciprocal tariffs"" on multiple countries in early April, stoking fears of a global recession. Many of those country-specific tariffs were paused a week later.

Gold, considered a safe asset amid geopolitical and economic uncertainties, has hit multiple record highs this year.

Meanwhile, Fed officials at their May 6?7 meeting acknowledged possible ""difficult tradeoffs"" ahead, with rising inflation and unemployment, and warned about growing recession risks, according to meeting minutes.

Markets now await U.S. GDP data due later in the day, along with core U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures figures on Friday, for further cues on the Fed's policy path.

May 28 (Reuters) - Gold prices steadied on Wednesday as investors assessed the U.S. Federal Reserve's May meeting minutes, which flagged rising inflation and recession risks, reinforcing gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset at a time when the global economic environment remains volatile.

Spot gold XAU= held steady at $3,299.95 an ounce as of 02:20 p.m. EDT (1820 GMT).

U.S. gold futures GCcv1 settled 0.2% lower at $3,294.90.

""The gold market has been kind of choppy recently, just reacting to fresh daily fundamental news events with no real trending price action,"" said Jim Wyckoff, Kitco Metals' senior analyst.

Fed officials at their May 6?7 meeting acknowledged possible ""difficult tradeoffs"" ahead, with rising inflation and unemployment, and warned about growing recession risks, according to meeting minutes.

The meeting took place amid heightened concerns over global trade tensions, following U.S. President Donald Trump's early April announcement of major import tariffs. Some of the most aggressive levies, however, were eased or delayed a week later.

Gold, which performs well in a low-interest rate environment and serves as a safe haven during times of uncertainty, has gained 26% so far this year and hit a record high in April.

Goldman Sachs recommended on Wednesday a higher-than-usual allocation to gold in long-term portfolios, citing elevated risks to U.S. institutional credibility, pressure on the Fed and sustained central bank demand.

Focus is also on Thursday's U.S. GDP data, Friday's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) numbers and comments from U.S. central bank officials.

Elsewhere, gold imports to Switzerland from the United States jumped in April to the highest monthly level since at least 2012, after the exclusion of precious metals from U.S. import tariffs, data showed.

90,Libya says oil leak occurs in pipeline south of Zawiya city,"Adds details, background

May 24 (Reuters) - An oil leak forced the shutdown of a pipeline south of Libya's city of Zawiya, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Saturday.

Zawiya, 40 km (25 miles) west of the capital Tripoli, is home to Libya's biggest functioning refinery, with a capacity of 120,000 barrels per day. The refinery is connected to the country's 300,000-barrels-per-day Sharara oilfield.

The NOC posted a picture showing a stream of leaked oil in the desert. Flow from the Hamada oilfields through the affected pipeline was immediately halted, the company said in a statement.

""In parallel with the maintenance work, a team of specialists is conducting an investigation to determine the causes of the leak. Arrangements and coordination are also underway to recover the leaked oil and address any resulting environmental pollution,"" the company added.

Eight OPEC+ members meet on Saturday to decide on July output
UAE says OPEC+ must be mindful of rising oil demand
For an EXPLAINER on OPEC+ output cuts, click here
LONDON/DUBAI, May 27 (Reuters) - OPEC+ is likely to agree to a further accelerated oil output hike for July this week, three delegates from the group told Reuters, in the latest stage of a plan to meet rising demand and increase market share.

When the 22-member group meets on Wednesday to review the market, it is not expected to change policy, the sources said.

But they said they expected an output hike to be agreed for July when the eight OPEC+ members meet on Saturday.

OPEC+, which includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies such as Russia, has agreed three layers of output cuts since 2022 to support the market, two of which are in place until the end of next year.

Eight members began unwinding the most recent layer in April, and for May and June made larger-than-expected hikes of 411,000 barrels per day.

Three OPEC+ sources told Reuters the eight members at their meeting on Saturday may decide on a similar 411,000 bpd output hike for July. All sources declined to be identified by name due to the sensitivity of the matter.

""We assign a high probability to another sizeable output increase of 411,000 bpd,"" SEB analyst Ole Hvalbye said. ""However, this potential hike seems largely priced in already,"" he added.

United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, asked about the plan for July output on Tuesday, said OPEC+ was doing its best to balance the oil market and needed to be mindful of rising demand.

Oil LCOc1 fell to a four-year low in April below $60 per barrel after OPEC+ said it was accelerating its output hike in May and as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs raised concerns of global economic weakness. Since then it has recovered to about $65.

Earlier this month, sources told Reuters that the eight countries, in addition to another 411,000 bpd output hike for July, may unwind the remainder of their voluntary hikes by the end of October.

Wednesday's talks are scheduled to begin at 1300 GMT, the sources said.

108,"Kazakhstan's daily oil output fell 4% in May on lower Tengiz production, source says","MOSCOW, June 2 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's oil production fell 4% in May from April due to lower production from the Tengiz oilfield, but remained above the OPEC+ quota, according to an industry source familiar with the statistics, and Reuters calculations.

Kazakhstan, a top-10 oil producer, has persistently exceeded quotas set by OPEC+, an alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers led by Russia. Kazakhstan officials said the state had informed the group that it had no plans to cut back its output.

Kazakhstan produced 1.748 million bpd of oil in May, according to the source. The country's OPEC+ quota for May is 1.486 million bpd.

Russia's budget deficit is widening
Russia has opposed OPEC+ output hike, sources say
Recasts, adds expected oil and gas revenues in June

MOSCOW, June 4 (Reuters) - Russia's oil and gas revenue fell by 35% year-on-year in May to 512.7 billion roubles ($6.55 billion), data from the finance ministry showed on Wednesday, as weakening oil prices and sanctions weighed on the country's economy.

Russia needs higher oil prices to balance its budget and fund its military operation in Ukraine.

Sources with knowledge of the talks told Reuters that Russia opposed recent oil output hikes by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+.

Oil and gas revenue has been the most important source of cash for the Kremlin, accounting for about a quarter to half of total federal budget proceeds over the past decade.

According to the finance ministry, revenue in May fell to 512.7 billion roubles ($6.55 billion), 35% lower that in the same month a year ago.

Revenue also fell by 53% from April as global oil prices declined, while the rouble strengthened. Reuters expected the revenue at 520 billion roubles.

The finance ministry also said it expected oil and gas revenue in June to be less by 40.3 billion roubles than had been planned.

The fall in oil priceshave been painful for Russia, which ran a budget deficit of 3.2 trillion roubles, or 1.5% of gross domestic product, in the first four months of the year.

Russia's finance ministry has also raised the 2025 budget deficit estimate to 1.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) from 0.5%, after reducing the energy revenues forecast by 24% due to expectations of a prolonged period of low oil prices.

Budget proceeds from oil and gas fell by 14.4% in January to May from the same period a year ago to 4.24 trillion roubles, finance ministry data showed on Wednesday.

Gold wedding purchases in India cool
Updates for market closer

May 30 (Reuters) - Gold prices slipped on Friday as the dollar edged higher and markets digested the latest tariff developments, while a softer inflation report kept hopes for a U.S. rate cut alive.

Spot gold XAU= was down 0.7%, at $3,293.59 an ounce, as of 02:26 pm ET (1826 GMT) and was down 1.9% so far this week.

U.S. gold futures GCcv1 settled 0.9% lower at $3,315.40.

The dollar index =USD rose 0.1%, making gold more expensive for other currency holders.

A federal appeals court temporarily reinstated the most sweeping of President Donald Trump's tariffs on Thursday, a day after a U.S. trade court ruled that Trump had exceeded his authority in imposing the duties and ordered an immediate block on them.

""Gold at this point in time is pulling back off these recent highs and is in a consolidation period,"" said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.

""Gold is under slight pressure as we're seeing a little lesser need for safe-haven but it does look like there is going to be significant push back from Trump and that will eventually help prices.""

On the data front, the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures Price index (PCE) saw a year-on-year increase of 2.1% in April, versus a 2.2% forecast.

After the report, traders continued to bet that the U.S. central bank will cut its target for short-term borrowing costs in September.

Bullion, which thrives in a low-interest rate environment and is also used to hedge against inflation and uncertainty, hit a record high of $3,500.05 in April.

May 30 (Reuters) - Gold prices fell on Friday and were headed for weekly loss amid a slight uptick in dollar, while investors awaited a key U.S. inflation report that may provide further insight into the Federal Reserve's policy trajectory.

Spot gold XAU= was down 0.4% at $3,303.51 an ounce, as of 0601 GMT. Bullion is down 1.6% so far this week.

U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.5% to $3,300.70.

The dollar index .DXY rose 0.2%, making gold more expensive for overseas buyers.

""Gold prices are more or less consolidating at this point of time,"" said Brian Lan, managing director at GoldSilver Central, Singapore.

""What we see is that these are normal market occurrences just at the range now is slightly wider mainly due to the confidence in the U.S. dollar.""

The U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, is due at 1230 GMT and is likely to show that inflation rose 2.2% in April, according to economists polled by Reuters, compared with a 2.3% increase in March.

San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Thursday that policymakers could still reduce rates twice this year, but rates should remain steady for now to ensure inflation is on track to reach the central bank's 2% goal.

Non-yielding bullion tends to benefit in low-interest-rate environments.

Meanwhile, a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated President Donald Trump's most extensive tariffs on Thursday, following a U.S. trade court's ruling on Wednesday that Trump had overstepped his authority by imposing these duties and subsequently ordered an immediate halt.

May 29 (Reuters) - Gold prices rebounded on Thursday on dip-buying after touching a more than one-week low earlier in the session after a U.S. trade court blocked most of President Donald Trump's tariffs, while the spotlight shifted to key U.S. inflation data later this week.

Spot gold XAU= was up 0.2% at $3,296.63 an ounce, as of 1114 GMT, after hitting its lowest since May 20.

U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were steady at $3,294.60.

The Manhattan-based Court of International Trade ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board duties on U.S. trade partners. The White House swiftly appealed the decision and signaled it may take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary.

""There is an element of dip buying... along with ongoing economic uncertainty, especially around U.S. debt and global trade tensions, which continues to support a positive outlook for gold despite recent developments,"" said Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at brokerage firm ActivTrades.

The United States has ordered a broad swathe of companies to stop shipping goods to China without a license and revoked licenses already granted to certain suppliers, said three people familiar with the matter.

""This morning's recovery is also linked to the weakening of the US dollar,"" Evangelista added. USD/

Gold, considered a safe asset amid geopolitical and economic uncertainties, has hit multiple record highs this year.

Meanwhile, Fed officials at their May 6?7 meeting acknowledged possible ""difficult tradeoffs"" ahead, with rising inflation and unemployment, and warned about growing recession risks, according to meeting minutes.

Meanwhile, Trump backed away from his threat to impose 50% tariffs on imports from the European Union next month, restoring a July 9 deadline to allow for talks between Washington and the 27-nation bloc to produce a deal.

Trump on Sunday restored a July 9 deadline to allow for talks between Washington and the European Union to produce a deal.

On Friday, gold prices recorded their best week in six last week, after Trump renewed tariff threats on EU goods and said he was considering a 25% tariff on any Apple AAPL.O iPhones that are sold in the U.S. but not made there.

""We still look for higher prices over the coming months, expecting the yellow metal to retest the level of $3,500/oz,"" Staunovo said.

Meanwhile, China's net gold imports via Hong Kong more than doubled in April from March, and were the highest since March 2024, data showed.

Citi on Sunday upgraded its zero-to-three month price target for gold back to $3,500/oz - from $3,150 - amid U.S. tariff policies, geopolitical risks and concerns around the U.S. budget. The bank expects gold prices to consolidate between $3,100/oz and $3,500/oz.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 slipped 26 cents, or 0.41%, to $63.89 a barrel by 0104 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 fell 27 cents, or 0.44%, to $60.67 a barrel. The Brent July futures contract is due to expire on Friday.

In the U.S., President Donald Trump's tariffs were to remain in effect after a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated them on Thursday, reversing a trade court's decision on Wednesday to put an immediate block on the most sweeping of the duties.

The block had sent oil prices falling more than 1% on Thursday as traders weighed its effects. Analysts said uncertainty would remain as the tariff battles worked their way through the court system.

Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, are expected to decide on a July oil production hike when they meet on Saturday.

At the same time, OPEC is trying to ensure that some countries that have been producing above their agreed levels, such as Kazakhstan, cut their output.

""The standoff between OPEC and Kazakhstan became even more apparent this week,"" Westpac's head of commodity and carbon research Robert Rennie said in a note.

Kazakhstan has informed OPEC that it does not intend to reduce its oil production, according to a Thursday report by Russia's Interfax news agency citing Kazakhstan's deputy energy minister.

Kazakhstan's energy minister on Thursday dismissedcomplaints from other members over Kazakhstan's overproduction, saying that the country's share in global production is less than 2% and that an oil price above $70-$75 per barrel is likely to be suitable for all countries.

""The stage is set for another bumper production increase,"" Rennie said, potentially higher than the 411,000 barrels per day hike decided on at the previous two meetings.

118,"US crude stockpiles fall, fuel builds as refiners hike output, EIA says","Adds detail, commentary, market reaction throughout

NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell last week as oil refiners ramped up production with the start of the summer driving season, while fuel inventories rose amid weaker demand, data from the Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday.

Crude inventories fell by 4.3 million barrels to 436.1 million barrels in the week ended May 30, the EIA said, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1 million-barrel draw.

Refinery crude runs USOICR=ECI rose by 670,000 barrels per day, the EIA said, while utilization rates USOIRU=ECI jumped 3.2 percentage points to 93.4% of total capacity.

Gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI rose by 5.2 million barrels in the week to 228.3 million barrels, the EIA said, compared with expectations for a 600,000-barrel build.

Product supplied of gasoline, a proxy for demand, fell by 1.2 million barrels per day to 8.3 million barrels, despite the start of the summer driving season after the Memorial Day holiday weekend, typically a time of increased demand.

The lower demand number raised some concerns.

""There was a strong increase in refinery demand for crude, resulting in a large crude draw,"" said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst with UBS. ""But post-Memorial Day, the strong supply increase with weaker implied demand resulted in large refined product inventory increases.""

Immediately following the data, U.S. crude prices CLc1 pared gains and last traded near flat at $63.40 a barrel. ?

Distillate stockpiles USOILD=ECI, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 4.2 million barrels in the week to 107.6 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1 million-barrel rise, the EIA data showed.

Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub USOICC=ECI rose by 576,000 barrels, the EIA said.

Net U.S. crude imports USOICI=ECI rose last week by 389,000 bpd.

92,Oil Modestly Higher On Supply Concerns,"Oil prices eked out modest gains on Monday after Ukraine was hit by a massive Russian drone and missile attack for the second night in a row, raising supply concerns.

Oil prices were also buoyed by a weaker dollar and U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to extend a deadline for imposing steep tariffs on the EU.

At least 12 people were killed and more than 60 injured early Sunday following a second consecutive night of large-scale Russian drone attacks, Ukrainian authorities said.

Russian forces reportedly launched a barrage of 367 drones and missiles at Ukrainian cities overnight, in the largest aerial attack of the war so far.

U.S. President Donald Trump has called his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, ""crazy"" and warned Moscow that any attempt at a total takeover of Ukraine would ""lead to the downfall of Russia.

Elsewhere, Israeli military strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, including a senior rescue service official and a journalist, local health authorities said.

The U.S. dollar began the week on a tepid note as growth concerns lingered following President Trump's tariff threat to Apple, Samsung and other smartphone manufacturers.

At the same time, Trump delayed the roll out of 50 percent tariffs on the European Union to July 9 from June 1, following a call from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

""The EU and US share the world's most consequential and close trade relationship. Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively. To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9,"" Von der Leyen wrote on X.

153,Gold steadies as modest US jobs data offsets trade uncertainty,"OECD warns of global economic slowdown due to trade war
China tells US to get ties back on ""right track""
Fed officials cautious on policy outlook amid trade uncertainty
Adds comment and updates for Asian mid-session trading

June 4 (Reuters) - Gold prices steadied on Wednesday as a somewhat strong U.S. jobs data for April offset the lingering uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations and global economic concerns.

Spot gold XAU= was stable at $3,351.49 an ounce as of 0609 GMT. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 also held steady at $3,375.

""We potentially see dip-buyers coming back into the picture and... things are still uncertain, especially surrounding the trade relationship between China and U.S. and even in EU and U.S. as well,"" said Kelvin Wong, a senior market analyst, Asia Pacific at OANDA.

However, ""the JOLTS job data helped sooth some concerns about the potential economic hit on the U.S. economy from tariffs, which is keeping demand for safety assets for gold in check,"" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.

The White House signaled that President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping might engage in talks later this week to address the trade disagreements.

The U.S. should create the necessary conditions for bilateral relations to get back onto ""the right track,"" China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the U.S. ambassador to Beijing.

Job openings in the United States rose in April, though layoffs surged to their highest level in nine months, economic data showed, hinting at softening labor market conditions.

Global economic concerns deepened after the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned of sharper-than-expected economic slowdown, as the Trump administration's trade policies weigh heavily on the U.S. economy.

""(The OECD report) for sure will be another supporting factor to see safe demand being heated up as well from a medium-term perspective,"" Wong said.

Federal Reserve officials reiterated their cautious policy stance, citing risks from trade tensions and economic uncertainty.

Gold tends to perform well during economic uncertainty.

Updates prices as of 1155 GMT

May 27 (Reuters) - Gold prices declined more than 1% on Tuesday as the dollar's reversal to trade higher added to the pressure on the safe-haven asset following U.S. President Donald Trump's less aggressive trade stance towards the European Union.

Spot gold XAU= was down 1.6% at $3,289.93 an ounce as of 1155 GMT. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 2.3% to $3,287.80.

Prices had softened on Monday as well after Trump, on Sunday, retreated from his threat to impose new tariffs on the European Union next month, instead reinstating a July 9 deadline for trade negotiations.

""Gold trades lower for a second day with technical selling along a descending trendline ... from the April record high, being supported by reduced haven demand amid rising stocks after Trump softened his aggressive trade stance with the EU,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.

The U.S. dollar index .DXY reversed earlier declines to trade 0.3% higher, making greenback-priced gold more expensive for overseas buyers.

Market participants also await speeches from several Federal Reserve policymakers this week and Friday's U.S. inflation (core PCE) data to gauge the central bank's rate cut trajectory. Lower rates increase non-yielding bullion's appeal.

""Gold traders will be watching incoming U.S. economic data for signs of a tariff-related slowdown and/or a pick up in inflation,"" Hansen added.

Investors are currently anticipating 47 basis points worth of rate cuts by the end of this year, starting in October. USDIRPR

""The shorter term outlook is unchanged: gold is still consolidating. We expect prices to remain supported while the markets contend with continued uncertainty, but we believe that the high is in,"" StoneX analyst Rhona O'Connell said in a note.

Elsewhere, spot silver XAG= slipped 1.4% to $32.88 per ounce, platinum XPT= fell 1.1% to $1,073.22 and palladium XPD= dropped 1.3% to $974.50.

112,"Oil rises on Iran, Russia and Canada supply concerns","June 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose in early Asia trade on Tuesday on concerns about supply, with Iran set to reject a U.S. nuclear deal proposal that would be key to easing sanctions on the major oil producer, and with production in Canada hit by wildfires.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 gained 55 cents, or 0.85%, to $65.18 a barrel by 0000 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 was up 59 cents, or 0.94%, to $63.11 a barrel, after rising around 1% earlier in the session.

Both contracts gained nearly 3% in the previous session after OPEC+ agreed to keep output increases in July at 411,000 barrels per day, which was less than some in the market had feared and the same hike as in the previous two months.

Geopolitical tensions supported prices on Tuesday. Iran was poised to reject a U.S. proposal to end a decades-old nuclear dispute, an Iranian diplomat said on Monday, saying it fails to address Tehran's interests or soften Washington's stance on uranium enrichment.

If nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran fail, it could mean continued sanctions on Iran, which would limit Iranian supply and be supportive of oil prices.

The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine continued to stoke supply concerns and geopolitical risk premiums.

Adding to supply worries, a wildfire in the province of Alberta in Canada has prompted a temporary shutdown of some oil and gas production, which could reduce supply.

According to Reuters calculations, wildfires in Canada have affected more than 344,000 bpd of oil sands production, or about 7% of the country's overall crude oil output.

The big jump in oil prices on Monday mostly reflected relief that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, did not go ahead with a larger production hike than in the previous two months.

""With the worst fears not panning out, investors unwound their bearish positions they had built prior to the weekendï¿½ï¿½s meeting,"" Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at ANZ, said in a note.

June 2 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose more than 1% on Monday as an escalation in the Russian war in Ukraine and U.S. President Donald Trump's fresh threat to double tariffs on imported steel and aluminium prompted investors to seek refuge in safe-haven bullion.

Spot gold XAU= was up 1.2% at $3,326.45 an ounce, as of 0606 GMT. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 rose 1.1% to $3,351.

Markets are awaiting speeches from several U.S. Federal Reserve officials this week for cues on the monetary policy outlook, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell set to speak later in the day.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller said that interest rate cuts remain possible later this year even as the Trump administration's tariff regime is likely to push up price pressures temporarily.

Gold, which is considered a safe-haven asset during the time of geopolitical and economic uncertainty, tends to thrive in a low-interest rate environment.

Meanwhile, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to speak soon to iron out trade issues including a dispute over critical minerals, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday.

128,News: UPDATE 1-Egypt's state grain buyer diversifies wheat sources amid geopolitical risk,"CAIRO, June 4 (Reuters) - Egypt's state grain buying agency, Mostakbal Misr, has secured major wheat contracts with strategic partners in France and Romania as part of a broader push to diversify supply and stabilise imports amid global uncertainty, it told Reuters on Wednesday.

The agency said it has overcome its dependence on traditional sourcing regions and now holds a dominant position in global supply routes, including South America and Australia.

Egypt, among the world's top wheat importers, is adapting to mounting geopolitical risks and volatility in Black Sea supplies, particularly from Ukraine and Russia.

One key element of the agency's strategy is deferred purchasing, which it says allows it to anticipate market movements and secure cargoes at optimal prices while maintaining supply stability.

In May, Egypt received significant volumes of premium wheat and vegetable oils from multiple global sources with the agency describing Egypt's current supply chains as ""strong, continuous, and expanding.""

22,News: RPT-COLUMN-Funds finally pauseÂ cornÂ selloff as focus turns to US crop: Braun,"NAPERVILLE, Illinois, June 1 (Reuters) - Speculators have made unprecedented moves in Chicago corn so far in 2025 as the combination of geopolitical uncertainties and supply trends sparked heavy selling, turning a strongly bullish market into a bearish one.

June officially kicks off the summer growing season for U.S. corn, a timeframe that can have investors rapidly changing gears along with weather forecasts and crop health, regardless of the wider fundamental picture.

This puts both bearish and bullish sentiments in play for the near future.


CORN SCENARIOS

In the week ended May 27, money managers trimmed their net short position in CBOT corn futures and options to 100,760 contracts, down less than 3,000 on the week.

While this new position isn?™t hugely bearish historically, it follows an impressive selloff. Between late February and mid-May, money managers were net sellers of more than 420,000 corn contracts, equivalent to 2.1 billion bushels and the most ever for an 11-week span.

Most-active CBOT corn futures Cv1 fell 10.5% over that period and new-crop December corn CZ25 eased more than 6%. December corn settled at $4.38-1/2 per bushel on Friday, a five-year low for the date.

Trade fears have been swirling for months, and confusion mounted further last week. U.S. President Donald Trump?™s sweeping trade tariffs were deemed unconstitutional by a U.S. trade court, though the ruling was paused a day later.

On the fundamental front, traders have been weighing strong U.S. corn demand with the expectation for expanding supplies.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture last month predicted 2025-26 U.S. corn ending stocks will rise 27% on the year, larger than the 14% rise that was projected in October.

However, the 2025-26 stockpiles themselves are seen 21% lighter than the October forecast suggested, leaving some room for a bull-friendly scenario should corn yields disappoint.

As such, speculators are likely to react if there is any such risk to yields. Take 2023 for example, which featured very similar fund movements as 2025, especially on timing.


As of June 2023, the 2023-24 U.S. corn carryout was projected to rise 55% on the year. Still, funds dipped into bullish territory twice that summer due to weather scares, even though the U.S. corn crop ended up notching a record yield.

Speculators turned bearish in August 2023 and did not flip back over to the bull side again until November 2024, so any upcoming opportunities for bulls could be short-lived if U.S. weather scares don?™t persist.


QUICK RUNDOWN

In the week ended May 27, money managers extended their net long in CBOT soybean futures and options to 36,697 contracts from 12,654 a week earlier. That marked their seventh consecutive week as soybean bulls.

Funds trimmed their net long in CBOT soybean oil futures and options to 53,988 contracts from 57,309 a week earlier. They also reduced their net short in soybean meal to 93,785 contracts from the previous week?™s record of 107,466.

Money managers through May 27 cut their net short in CBOT wheat futures and options to 101,226 contracts from 108,893 a week earlier. They also trimmed their Minneapolis wheat net short to 30,518 contracts from the previous week?™s record of 34,140.

As of May 27, funds??net short in Kansas City wheat futures and options stood at 79,361 contracts, close to the all-time record set two weeks earlier.

Between Wednesday and Friday, moves in most-active CBOT futures were as follows: corn -3.4%, soybeans -2%, wheat +1%, soyoil -5.4%, and soymeal was unchanged.

Traders will be watching this week for any developments on either the tariff or biofuel front, as well as for U.S. weather forecasts and crop conditions. USDA will publish its first condition rating for the U.S. soybean crop on Monday.

23,News: RPT-COLUMN-US ethanol output eases off record pace as summer travels heat up: Braun,"NAPERVILLE, Illinois, May 30 (Reuters) - Record volumes of U.S. ethanol have been churned out since late last year, largely due to an uptick in exports and steady domestic demand.

But output has slipped from those record levels over the last couple of weeks, coinciding with the ramp-up of the summer driving season.

Luckily, large stockpiles of the corn-based fuel additive can offset some of the easing in output for now.

However, both exports and domestic travel trends will need to be monitored in the coming weeks and months since this is when U.S. motor gasoline demand typically peaks.


RECENT DATA

Over the four weeks ended May 23, U.S. ethanol production averaged roughly 1.026 million barrels per day. That is the best for the period in six years but behind the levels of six and seven years ago.


Ethanol production typically dips at this time of year and output had been running at record rates from late last year through early spring, causing supplies to approach the 2020 records in March.


U.S. ethanol stocks have since experienced a seasonal drawdown but remain at record levels for the date, with strong rates of both production and use somewhat offsetting each other. Huge exports have contributed to the elevated use levels in recent months.



On the other hand, implied U.S. motor gasoline demand has not necessarily been impressive. Over the last couple of months, rates have been similar to the year-ago levels but well off the volumes before the pandemic, which was when demand for U.S. gasoline is thought is thought to have peaked.



Increased fuel efficiency and post-pandemic changes in driving patterns ??particularly remote working ??have reduced U.S. gasoline consumption, an inherent threat to the U.S. ethanol industry.

But the push for cleaner fuels abroad has been a bright spot. Although exports accounted for just 11% of U.S. ethanol produced in the 2023-24 marketing year, shipments reached record levels, supported by Canadian, British and Indian demand.


EXPORTS AND TRAVEL FACE OFF

Although exports have been the cornerstone of the U.S. ethanol industry this year, they have largely slowed below the year-ago levels in the last month or so, hitting an eight-week low last week.

Exporters do have a cushion, as September-March shipments were easily a record for the period, up 26% on the year.

However, this recent easing in ethanol exports could potentially be offset by a bump in U.S. gasoline demand this summer.

As of April 2025, some 53% of Americans planned to take leisure vacations this summer versus 48% a year earlier, according to Deloitte?™s annual travel survey. This is despite a decline in their sense of financial well-being over the last year.

The more frugal approach means that Americans plan to increasingly favor driving trips versus the previous few summers, including a higher frequency of trips as many are adding multiple short getaways.

Gas prices are largely friendly for that effort, with the national average price for unleaded fuel sitting about 11% lower than a year ago.

But consumer habits can abruptly shift whenever economic uncertainty spikes, and 2025 has been particularly rife with those risks.

Intensifying Russia-Ukraine conflict raises grain supply fears

Favourable US Midwest crop weather to cap corn, soybean prices

Updates prices, adds detail

By Naveen Thukral and Sybille de La Hamaide

SINGAPORE/PARIS, June 5 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures rose on Thursday, supported by the escalating conflict between major grain suppliers Russia and Ukraine, a weak dollar, as well as dry weather threatening yields in top consumer China.

Corn prices firmed, but soybeans edged lower.

""Ukraine has hit Russia and there are fears of escalation which is supporting wheat prices,"" said one trader in Singapore.

A weak dollar against major currencies was also supporting prices although it was not enough to keep soybean prices in green territory. USD/

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 rose 0.5% to $5.46 a bushel, as of 1040 GMT. Corn Cv1 added 0.7% to $4.41-3/4 a bushel, while soybeans Sv1 gave up 0.2% to $10.42-1/2 a bushel.

Parts of China's wheat belt in Shaanxi and Henan provinces have been hit hard by hot and dry weather, with near-record temperatures threatening to reduce yields.

Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Russian targets, prompting Russian President Vladimir Putin to tell the U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation that Moscow would have to respond, escalating worries over grain supplies.

Ukrainian corn exports are set to fall to 1 million metric tons in June from 2 million tons in May, as Ukraine-origin corn is uncompetitive compared to its American equivalent, producers' union UAC said on Wednesday.

Corn and soybean prices are being capped by favourable weather in the U.S. Midwest, where farmers are wrapping up their planting.

52,News: CBOT nearby corn contract ends higher on technical trading,"CHICAGO, May 22 (Reuters) - Chicago Board of Trade's most-active July corn futures contract ended higher on Thursday on technical trading, while deferred contract months turned lower on a steadier U.S. dollar, weaker crude oil and generally favorable crop conditions, market analysts said.

A stronger dollar makes U.S. supplies more expensive in export markets.

CBOT July corn CN25 settled up 2 cents at $4.63 a bushel. The contract ended higher for a fourth session.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said exporters sold a net 1,190,800 metric tons of old-crop U.S. corn last week and 218,400 tons of new-crop corn, both down from a week earlier but in line with trade expectations. EXP/CORN

The International Grains Council raised its forecast for 2025/26 global corn production by 3 million metric tons to 1.277 billion tons.

Rain across much of the U.S. Midwest delayed planting and stoked concerns that total acreage could decline. But gains were limited as rains were seen boosting already planted crops, analysts said.

Market eyes U.S.-China trade talks for price direction

Updates prices

SINGAPORE, June 4 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures slid for a second session on Wednesday, with the improved condition of the U.S. crop boosting supply prospects.

Soybeans eased amid crop-friendly weather in the U.S. Midwest, while corn ticked higher.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 fell 0.1% to $5.35-1/2 a bushel, as of 0330 GMT, and soybeans Sv1 lost 0.1% to $10.39-1/4 a bushel. Corn Cv1 added 0.1% to $4.39 a bushel.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly crop progress report showed on Monday that 50% of U.S. spring wheat and 52% of winter wheat are in good to excellent condition, exceeding analyst expectations.

Favourable U.S. weather has also bolstered corn and soybean production prospects, keeping a lid on prices.

On Tuesday, higher crude oil prices CLc1 lifted the soybean complex as well as corn, given both crops' role in the production of biofuels.

Corn fell, while soybeans were largely unchanged.


FUNDAMENTALS

* The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 fell 0.5% to $5.36-1/4 a bushel, as of 0012 GMT. Corn Cv1 lost 0.4% to $4.36-3/4 a bushel and soybeans Sv1 fell quarter of a cent to $10.33-1/4 a bushel.

Updates with wheat rebounding at end of overnight session

PARIS/SINGAPORE, June 3 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat rose on Tuesday to reverse an earlier fall as news of further Ukrainian strikes against Russian targets kept attention on war escalation and offset supply pressure from better-than-expected U.S. crop ratings.

Corn and soybeans rebounded after hitting six-month and seven-week lows, respectively, that were also linked to good crop conditions.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 ended the overnight trading session up 0.9% at $5.43-3/4 a bushel.

The contract had risen sharply during Monday's session as a Ukrainian drone attack in Russia shifted attention back on the war between the two grain exporters.

Prices pared their gains by Monday's close and then fell earlier on Tuesday as immediate fears of war escalation subsided and higher than anticipated scores for wheat conditions in a weekly U.S. Department of Agriculture crop progress report.

However, news that Ukraine had hit the road and rail bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula, as well as also knocking out power in parts of other Russian-held territory in southern Ukraine, later revived concerns about a hardening conflict between the two grain exporting countries.

""It looks like the Ukrainians are pursuing their attacks,"" a European trader said.

Favourable Northern Hemisphere supply prospects, slow international demand and a bounce in the dollar index =USD, which makes U.S. grain dearer overseas, nonetheless kept a lid on wheat prices, traders said.

By Naveen Thukral

SINGAPORE, June 5 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures rose on Thursday, supported by the escalating conflict between major grain suppliers Russia and Ukraine, as well as dry weather threatening yields in top consumer China.

Corn prices firmed, but soybeans edged lower.

""Ukraine has hit Russia and there are fears of escalation which is supporting wheat prices,"" said one trader in Singapore.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 rose 0.6% to $5.46-1/4 a bushel, as of 0319 GMT. Corn Cv1 added 0.3% to $4.40 a bushel, while soybeans Sv1 gave up 0.1% to $10.44 a bushel.

Parts of China's wheat belt in Shaanxi and Henan provinces have been hit hard by hot and dry weather, with near-record temperatures threatening to reduce yields.

Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Russian targets, prompting Russian President Vladimir Putin to tell the U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation that Moscow would have to respond, escalating worries over grain supplies.

Ukrainian corn exports are set to fall to 1 million metric tons in June from 2 million tons in May, as Ukraine-origin corn is uncompetitive compared to its American equivalent, producers' union UAC said on Wednesday.

Corn and soybean prices are being capped by favourable weather in the U.S. Midwest, where farmers are wrapping up their planting.

127,News: Euronext wheat higher as Chicago rally offsets stronger euro,"PARIS, June 4 (Reuters) - European wheat futures edged up on Wednesday with support from a rally in Chicago, though the euro'sstrength limited gains in Paris and kept prices near contract lows.

Chicago wheat Wv1 climbed around 2% in U.S. trading, supported by a drop in the dollar =USD along with concern over heavy rain in some U.S. wheat zones. GRA/

A corresponding rise in the euro EUR= weighed on Euronext, reinforcing negative export sentiment amid a lull in international demand. GRA/TEND

But the U.S. wheat rally and investors' reluctance to add to short positions helped Euronext continue holding above the 200 euro floor.

""The euro was strong again with the disappointing U.S. macro data,"" a futures dealer said. ""But funds are already extremely short so they don't necessarily want to sell.""

Financial investors extended their net short position in Euronext wheat last week, data published by the exchange on Wednesday showed.

War headlines this week, as Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Russian targets, have rekindled concerns about Black Sea grain trade.

PARIS/SINGAPORE, June 4 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat, corn and soybeans rose on Wednesday, underpinned by signs of a hardening conflict between Ukraine and Russia as well as hopes that tariff negotiations between Washington and grain importers like China and Vietnam will boost U.S. exports.

Favourable conditions for U.S. crops remained a curb on prices, which hit a six-month low for corn on Tuesday and a seven-week low for soybeans on Monday. GRA/

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 was up 0.6% at $5.39 a bushel by 1137 GMT.

The wheat market has been torn this week between concern over Black Sea grain trade, as Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Russian targets, and improved conditions for U.S. crops as estimated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly crop progress report on Monday.

""The renewed geopolitical tensions in the Black Sea continue to fuel market volatility,"" Argus analysts said in a note, adding, ""The stronger-than-expected increase in winter wheat and especially spring wheat crop ratings weighed on these products.""

Traders were also monitoring drought damage to the wheat crop in China, though it was unclear if this would prompt more imports given large Chinese stocks.

CBOT soybeans Sv1 edged up 0.5% to $10.46 a bushel, while corn Cv1 added 1.1% to $4.43-1/2 a bushel, putting the crops on course for a second daily rise as they recovered from this week's lows.

On the trade front, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are set to speak this week, the White House said on Monday, boosting hopes about negotiations, days after Trump accused China of violating an agreement to roll back tariffs and trade restrictions.

Worries about demand for U.S. soybeans from the world's biggest oilseed consumer have curbed soybean futures this year.

Vietnamese firms, meanwhile, have signed memorandums of understanding to buy $2 billion worth of American farm produce, including corn, wheat and soymeal as part of efforts to seal a new trade deal between the two countries.

145,"Russia needs action to remain world's top wheat exporter, government official says - Reuters","Releads, adds Patrushev's quotes in paragraphs 4,8,10; background

MOSCOW, May 30 (Reuters) - Russia needs to act swiftly in order to maintain its position as the world's top wheat exporter, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Patrushev said on Friday, acknowledging a sharp slowdown in wheat exports in the current season.

Patrushev, who is responsible for agriculture in the government, said Russia will export 44.5 million metric tons of wheat and 53 million tons of grain in the 2024-2025 season.

Russia did not disclose statistics for last season's wheat exports but the government's estimates stand at 53 million tons, while the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the figure of 55.5 million tons, implying a fall of up to 20% this year.

""The situation with grain exports is currently developing negatively. Compared to the same period in 2024, the dynamics are significantly lower,"" Patrushev told a conference in Sochi in southern Russia.

Russian farmers were hit by extreme weather last year. They are also complaining about falling profitability of growing wheat due to high export duties, rising costs for fuel and fertilizers, a strong rouble, and high interest rates.

Despite the fall in wheat exports, Russia maintains the status of the world's largest wheat exporter, but its share of the global market is set to shrink to 22% from 28% last season.

President Vladimir Putin ordered the government to boost agriculture exports by 50% by 2030 with grain exports hitting 80 million tons a year.

""Judging by the latest trend, the movement is going in the opposite direction, and this needs to be urgently corrected. We need to intensify supplies, we must work together to maintain Russia's positions in the global market,"" said Patrushev.

He flagged a change in the way the export duty is calculated as a possible measure to boost exports but said the duty, introduced to protect the domestic market, will remain in place.

""We proceed from the fact that export is an important sphere, but our priority is our domestic market. Based on this, we will make decisions,"" Patrushev said.

Patrushev urged exporters to find new markets and said the loading capacity at Russian ports should be increased and supporting infrastructure improved.

Russian exported grain at a record pace in the first part of the season but exports slowed sharply in February when export caps, also aimed at protecting the domestic market from food price inflation, took effect.

Patrushev said that he expected this year's harvest to be better than last year as the sowing campaign in many regions proceeded ahead of schedule.

Updates with European trading, changes byline/dateline

PARIS/SINGAPORE, June 2 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat rose on Monday as a Ukrainian drone attack in Russia shifted attention back on the war between the two grain exporters, while renewed U.S.-Chinese trade tensions weighed on the dollar.

Corn edged up as support from wheat and wider commodities offset favourable crop prospects in the United States and Brazil.

Soybeans extended losses to their lowest since mid-April, with tariff worries adding to pressure from benign crop weather in the U.S. Midwest and uncertainty over U.S. biofuel policy.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Wv1 rose 1.9% to $5.44-1/4 a bushel by 1222 GMT, heading for a fourth daily gain.

After being supported last week by lower than expected ratings of U.S. wheat crops, the market found further impetus in a lower dollar =USD, which makes U.S. grain cheaper overseas, and developments in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Russia and Ukraine began their second round of direct peace talks since 2022 in Istanbul on Monday with no sign they are closer to an agreement, one day after Kyiv struck some of Moscow's nuclear-capable bombers far inside Russian territory.

The dollar's drop, meanwhile, reflected renewed investor worries about tariffs, after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he planned to double duties on imported News Storyaluminium to 50%, and as Beijing hit back against Trump's accusations it violated an agreement on critical minerals shipments. FRX/

""The commodities sector has started the week with strong gains ... in response to heightened geopolitical and tariff tensions,"" Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note.

CBOT corn Cv1 added 0.5% to $4.46-1/4 a bushel while soybeans Sv1 fell 0.5% to $10.37 a bushel.

The latest tensions between Washington and Beijing put the focus back on tariffs that have sidelined U.S. soybeans from its biggest export market.

Demand sentiment in the soybean market has already been dented by a Reuters report that the U.S. government is considering exemptions for some oil refiners from biofuel mandates.

""Soybean demand issues are still a bearish factor for the market,"" said one oilseed trader in Singapore. ""U.S. weather has been benign for the crop, so we are not worried about the crop at this stage.""",,2025-06-02 22:48:00.000 +0900,2025-06-02 22:48:00.000 +0900,Wheat futures,TRUE,Reuters,TRUE

June 4 (Reuters) - Gold prices held steady on Wednesday as stronger U.S. jobs data countered safe-haven demand driven by simmering trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

Spot gold XAU= was steady at $3,349.19 an ounce, as of 1145 GMT. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were unchanged at $3,373.10.



""U.S. labor data gave markets a bit of relief yesterday, causing a small dip in gold prices. However, tensions between the U.S. and China are still keeping risks high and gold prices supported,"" said Zain Vawda, market analyst at MarketPulse by OANDA.

Job openings in the U.S. rose in April, though layoffs surged to their highest level in nine months, economic data showed, hinting at softening labor market conditions.

Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping is tough and ""extremely hard to make a deal with,"" days after the U.S. President accused China of violating an agreement to roll back tariffs and trade restrictions.

Washington doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Wednesday, the same day the Trump administration expects trading partners to make ""best offers"" to avoid other punishing import levies from taking effect in early July.

The focus will be on Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls data for more cues on the Federal Reserve's policy path. Federal Reserve's policy path. Fed officials have reiterated their cautious policy stance, citing risks from trade tensions and economic uncertainty.

""If the data is stronger than expected, interest rate cut expectations are likely to wane, which would weigh on the gold price,"" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.

58,More tremors force Ivanhoe to suspend copper output forecast at Congo mine,"Adds shares, details & analyst comment from paragraph 4

JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Reuters) - Ivanhoe Mines IVN.TO said on Monday it had suspended its output forecast for this year after seismic activities at its giant copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo halted underground mining operations.

The Canadian miner said guidance for the Kamoa-Kakula mining complex, initially set between 520,000 and 580,000 metric tons of copper, and its planned ramp up at the smelting plant, had been withdrawn.

Ivanhoe shares tumbled as much as 15.6% in morning trade in Toronto. The stock is down 36% so far this year, according to LSEG data.

The Vancouver-based miner said on May 20 it had initially suspended some mining activities in a section of its Kakula mine after seismic activities or underground tremors. The company said on Monday that it was forced again to suspend operations over the weekend due to seismic activities over the past few days.

""Seismic activity at the Kakula underground mine has continued to occur intermittently over the past few days,"" Ivanhoe said.

The tremors have also affected underground infrastructure, including water pumping and there has been an increase in water inflow levels into the Kakula mine, the miner said.

The operations at the adjacent Kamoa mine had not been interrupted, it said.

The suspension of production guidance ""leaves uncertainty as we await further updates to determine the potential impact on production,"" RBC Capital Markets said in a note.

On Friday, Ivanhoe contradicted joint venture partner Zijin Mining 601899.SS about the extent of problems at the mine.

The Chinese miner said on Friday in a public filing that the seismic activity could affect this year's planned copper production, a statement that Ivanhoe disputed on the grounds it was still conducting investigations.

The Congo mines produced about 437,000 metric tons of the metal last year.

On Monday Ivanhoe said it and Zijin would work together to bring the Kakula mine back into production as soon as possible.

Commission expects tighter global copper supply
Chilean production growth forecast for 2026 revised down
Adds new information from press conference in paragraphs 3-8

SANTIAGO, May 28 (Reuters) - Chile's state copper commission Cochilco raised its average copper price forecast for this year and next on Wednesday, citing an improved global outlook following a pause in the tariff war between the United States and China.

The commission increased its average price projection for both 2025 and 2026 to $4.30 per pound, up from a previous estimate of $4.25 in its February report.

In a press conference, Cochilco leadership expressed cautious optimism regarding copper prices, while acknowledging a tighter than expected global supply situation and strong demand fundamentals.

An agreement earlier this month between the U.S. and China to slash steep tariffs for at least 90 days ""has significantly reduced trade barriers, easing tensions that were affecting confidence and the dynamism of global trade,"" Cochilco said.

Cochilco also sees continued support for copper prices from long-term trends like the energy transition and the expansion of electricity grids, electric vehicles and energy storage.

Production increased in the first quarter at Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, and Antofagasta Minerals ANTO.L. State-owned Codelco's COBRE.UL production grew 5.2% in April, Cochilco said.

Still, the domestic increases did not offset a global decline. Cochilco now expects global supply growth this year to be much lower than it previously forecast, at 1.3% from a prior estimate of 4.7%.

Victor Garay, Cochilco's mining market coordinator, said that in a practically balanced market, any supply disruption would directly affect the price.

Separately, the agency projected that Chilean copper production would increase by 3% this year and again in 2026, when it is expected to reach 5.84 million metric tons.

The production guidance reflects a downgrade from Cochilco's February estimate of 4.6% growth in 2025 and 3.6% growth in 2026.

Globally, Cochilco expects a copper deficit of 109,000 tons this year and a slight surplus of 19,000 tons for 2026, amid demand growth of 2.3% and 2.8%, respectively.

Black Sea grain trade concerns amid Ukraine-Russia tensions

Corn and soybean futures rise on bargain buying

Updates with closing U.S. prices

By Julie Ingwersen

CHICAGO, June 4 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures rose more than 1% on Wednesday as signs of a hardening conflict between Ukraine and Russia and worries about dryness in China appeared to spark a round of short-covering, analysts said.

Corn and soybean futures also moved higher on bargain buying after the benchmark Chicago Board of Trade corn contract Cv1 hit a multi-month low and soybeans Sv1 touched a seven-week low earlier this week.

A setback in the dollar .DXY lent support, in theory making U.S. grains more attractive to those holding other currencies.

CBOT July wheat WN25 settled up 7-1/4 cents, or 1.35%, at $5.43-1/4 per bushel. July corn CN25 ended up 1/4 cent at $4.38-3/4 a bushel and July soybeans SN25 rose 4-1/4 cents to settle at $10.45 a bushel.

Wheat drew support from news that parts of China's wheat belt in Shaanxi and Henan provinces have been hit by hot, dry weather that could reduce harvests, though it was unclear if this would prompt more imports given large Chinese stocks.

Concerns over Black Sea grain trade simmered as Ukraine stepped up attacks on Russian targets. Russian President Vladimir Putin told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation that Moscow would have to respond to high-profile Ukrainian drone attacks, according to Trump.

Commodity funds hold a sizable net short position in CBOT wheat futures, leaving the market open to bouts of short-covering.

Corn and soybeans followed the higher trend but rallies were capped as weather is seen as mostly favorable in the Midwest crop belt, where planting is winding down.

""I don't see anything in the weather outlook that is particularly threatening,"" said Terry Linn, an analyst with Linn and Associates in Chicago.

On the trade front, Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are set to speak this week, the White House said on Monday, boosting hopes about negotiations after Trump accused China of violating an agreement to roll back tariffs and trade restrictions.

Vietnamese firms, meanwhile, signed memorandums of understanding to buy $2 billion worth of American farm produce, including corn, wheat and soymeal as part of efforts to seal a new trade deal between the two countries.

132,"Drought bakes China's wheat belt, slashing harvests for some - Reuters News","Parts of wheat belt in Shaanxi, Henan hit hard by hot, dry weather
Some farmers report harvest at half usual levels
Farmers with irrigation systems say yields steady
Impact of drought on Chinese wheat imports not yet clear
XIANYANG, China, June 4 (Reuters) - About an hour by road northwest of the famed Terracotta Warriors, combine harvesters send out clouds of dust as they work their way through the parched wheat fields of Maqiao village in China's northwestern Shaanxi province.

But local farmers like Zhou Yaping say there is little to celebrate.

Some of her crop is still tinged with green in a sign it hasn't fully ripened, and she expects she'll get only half the 1,000 kg of wheat her two-thirds of an acre plot usually yields.

""I've been growing wheat for over 20 years, and I've never seen a drought this bad,"" said Zhou, 50, during a late May visit.

Parts of China's wheat belt in Shaanxi and Henan provinces have been hit hard by hot, dry weather, with the sun baking the soil into cracked slabs and scorching the wheat before it could ripen.

Last month, Shaanxi recorded its highest average temperatures since records began in 1961.

While official figures are still some six weeks away, more than a dozen farmers in the area and those they hire to harvest the crop told Reuters of losses and small harvests, down as much as half for some.

In some parts of the province, the drought was so bad farmers brought the harvest forward by a week.

And while rain finally arrived in recent days, bringing some relief, it has also threatened to disrupt the harvest for those who waited.

It is too early to know whether the drought could prompt China to import more wheat, although that would be good news for growers in places including Australia, which expects high end-of-season wheat stocks, partly due to a drop in Chinese imports.

Ample wheat stocks and tepid demand have also curbed China's import appetite, traders said.

""The drought has had a significant impact on wheat yields in areas with poor irrigation infrastructure, but the overall reduction in output is not expected to be substantial,"" Rosa Wang at Shanghai agro-consultancy JCI told Reuters.

As of May 30, about 60% of the wheat crop in Henan and more than 20% in Shaanxi had been harvested, according to state news agency Xinhua.

Conditions vary across the vast agricultural belt. In Henan province, often called China's granary, a farmer surnamed Ma who runs a 50-acre (20.23 hectares) farm in Xinxiang said his output held steady because of irrigation.

But damage was clear elsewhere in the province.

In Zhumadian, another farmer, named Zhang, said he harvested 1.65 acres of wheat on May 23, more than a week earlier than usual due to the heat. Zhang, who spoke over the phone, said his yield was down 40%, similar to 2023 when floods led to sprouting and blight.

""After covering the costs of seeds, harvesting, and ploughing, we just break even with little to no profit,"" he said.

Ma and Zhang declined to share their full names for reasons of privacy.

175,Gold retreats from 2-week peak as Trump extends EU tariff deadline,"Dollar hits one-month low vs rivals
SPDR Gold Trust holdings fell 0.15% on Friday
Updates prices, as of 0659 GMT

May 26 (Reuters) - Gold prices slipped from a two-week high on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump set a July 9 deadline for a trade deal with the European Union, rescinding his earlier threat of a 50% tariff from June 1.

Spot gold XAU= was down 0.6% at $3,337.64 an ounce, as of 0659 GMT. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell nearly 1% to $3,336.50.

""There is (a) kind of element of relief in the marketplace after (the) pause on tariffs on the EU and we're seeing gold weaken,"" said Kyle Rodda, Capital.com's financial market analyst.

However, the trend is still positive for gold because of the United States' actions, which is impacting them as well and that could negatively impact the dollar and U.S. assets, Rodda said, adding that most of the central banks were moving away from the dollar to gold.

Trump on Sunday backed off his threat to speed up 50% tariffs on imports from the European Union, agreeing to extend his deadline for trade talks until July 9 after the head of the EU executive body said the bloc needed more time to ""reach a good deal.""

Gold prices rose more than 2% to a two-week peak on Friday, supported by safe-haven inflows after Trump recommended 50% tariffs on European Union imports from June 1 and said he was considering a 25% tariff on any Apple iPhones made outside the United States.

The dollar index .DXY, meanwhile, fell to a nearly one-month low against its rivals. A weaker dollar makes greenback-priced gold less expensive for other currency holders. USD/

On the geopolitical front, Russian forces launched a barrage of 367 drones and missiles at Ukrainian cities overnight, in the largest aerial attack of the war so far, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens more, officials said.

SPDR Gold Trust GLD, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.15% to 922.46 tons on Friday from 923.89 tons on Thursday.
